# one step closer to the ones we love

> It's time for Bruce and Tim to have a talk. One of several that will be necessary in the coming months, but, you know. Baby steps.

#### Notes: 

CPP is New Jersey's CPS department, within the DCF.

I hope today blesses you with any coffee or other warm drinks you would like to have and I hope you're doing well! 

Chapter title from You're Not Alone, by the Mowgli's.

* * *

“Tim,” Bruce says, when it’s just the two of them left in the lounge. “We need to talk about something.”

Tim tenses, just slightly. He takes a deep breath, even and measured, as he turns to look at Bruce from where he sits bundled up in blankets on the couch. 

Bruce raises a hand. “You’re not in trouble, Tim, don’t worry. You haven’t done anything wrong. I just want to talk with you about some logistics, okay?”

“Okay,” says Tim, and his fingers fidget with the tag on one of the blanket corners. He suddenly regrets insisting he felt better enough to come downstairs and watch Star Wars with the family. 

But he’s been completely wiped out for three days in a row, and if Alfred and Bruce hadn’t allowed the change of scenery now that he finally has more energy, he was probably going to just wear away at Jason until he helped Tim somewhere else in the manor anyway. 

Alfred, wise to the ways of growing boys (he had raised a particularly precocious one first, after all, and the trend only continued from there), had rendered that unnecessary by saying yes to Tim’s plea. 

So Tim is on the couch, and Bruce is in a chair, and no one is around to help Tim speed-shuffle somewhere (anywhere) else. He curses his still-weak muscles and joints.

“I want to clarify a few things before we talk about details, if that’s all right with you,” Bruce says. Tim nods. “You said Mrs. Mac comes on Wednesdays and Saturdays?”

“Yeah,” Tim says. “She comes early those days, cooks breakfast for both of us, and then does all the regular cleaning and housework. If I need her for other things, she’ll come if I call or text. And if my parents are home, she comes more days. Because there’s more dishes, and trash and stuff.”

“That makes sense. Has it always been like that at your house?”

“No, I used to have a nanny that was around most of the time. She’d do meals and stuff, and make sure I woke up and got to school, and went to bed on time.”

“When did you stop having a nanny?”

“The summer before I started eighth grade. That was our trial run, to make sure I would be responsible about a schedule and living in the house without someone to keep tabs on me all day. Make sure I didn’t, y’know, burn down the house on accident, or anything stupid. Mrs. Mac checked in every day back then, for an hour or two.”

“Hm,” says Bruce, and he sounds carefully neutral. Tim doesn’t like where this line of questioning seems to be headed. “What happens if something goes wrong, like a big storm, or you getting sick like last week?”

“I almost never get sick,” Tim says, a little defensively. “And I can take care of myself just fine. It’s not hard. Stay hydrated, eat soup, get rest. No one needs to watch me sleep all day. And if the power goes out from a storm, I call the power company and grab flashlights. It’s not complicated! It’s always worked out fine.”

“I apologize,” Bruce says, spreading his arms a little bit wider on the arms of his chair, opening himself up. A little of the defensive knot snarled up in Tim’s chest loosens. “I didn’t mean to offend you, Tim. You’ve done a great job taking care of yourself and the house for a long time.”

“Thanks,” Tim mutters. He wants this conversation to be over. But Bruce doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere soon.

“That being said,” Bruce adds, and here it is, Tim _knew_ it. He’s planned for this exact conversation, amid the hundreds and hundreds of situations planned contingencies for over the years. Tim is _prepared_ .

“You _can’t_ call CPP on me,” he says, more of a demand than anything else. 

Bruce closes his mouth, tilts his head slightly. Tim goes on. “First, even if you contacted them right now, and convinced them to open a case for me, my parents are out of the country until sometime in late February or March. They’re only taking communication from a few select people during that time, and even then it can be spotty because they’re working in the field, and there’s often nothing but satellite phone service. An open case can’t move forward through the process unless the parents are able to be contacted and involved, so CPP’s hands would be tied.”

Bruce actually looks a little surprised now, sits up straighter. He’s giving Tim his full attention, which is a little nerve-wracking since, y’know, that’s _Batman_ six feet away from Tim, and Tim is essentially trying to _out-logic Batman_ , and oh god what is even happening in his life anymore? 

But Timothy Jackson Drake is nothing if not logical and tenacious, so onward he goes. This _has_ to work. He didn’t expect it to be Batman he was having to have this conversation with, of all people, but at the end of the day a grown-up is a grown-up and Tim is _not_ willing to get shuffled into the system. He meets too many of the kids it’s failed. There’s a lot of kids it doesn’t, sure, and the system itself is necessary in society. Tim knows that. 

But he’s not going to be one of the kids in it. He’s only four years away from being legal, anyway, and it’s not like there’s been a problem with his family’s setup so far. 

“Second,” he goes on, gathering steam. “I currently have a stable life, with a solid living system, and all my financial, physical, and educational needs are met and _well_ exceeded. I live in an extremely safe neighborhood, go to an excellent academy, and never am left to go hungry or cold or anything else for even one day in my life. That’s worlds better than what many kids have, and CPP needs to devote their strained and overwhelmed resources to the kids who are in _actually_ _bad_ situations. Just because I have minimal adult supervision, it doesn’t mean I’m in any danger. 

“I’m mature for my age, which any adult who knows me at _all_ will confirm under questioning, and I’m extremely responsible. I have no disciplinary marks from any school I’ve been enrolled at. I have the money and knowledge to call for help for anything that needs to be done for the house or for myself that I can’t handle easily. The most dangerous thing that’s happened since my nanny moved on to a different job is the time I put Oreo Cakesters in the microwave and they sparked twice because I didn’t realize the packet was foil and not plastic.” Tim pauses for a breath, stamping down the need to cough because it would interrupt this _whole_ _thing_, and he can’t afford that. 

“Third,” he says firmly, and here it is, his trump card. “If I have reason to believe that you or anyone else is planning to file a report of neglect to CPP or any other authority in the state of New Jersey, including the GCPD, I can and will _immediately_ put into action my backup plan, which involves Mrs. Mac being paid _very_ generously to both have a presence in the Drake residence every single day of the week again _and_ state to anyone who asks that she has been doing so for years. Also, all peripheral staff that works at my home occasionally for things like landscaping will have incentive to confirm that narrative, including an overnight nanny I will immediately hire. CPP will have no case they can confirm enough to act on, and once my parents return from their current trip they can raise hellfire in this city’s media strongly enough that the scandal will turn public opinion against the CPP and the case will fizzle into oblivion. Even digging up records proving how much my parents are out of the country won’t be enough to make any changes happen, because I have the resources to get records produced on my end for all involved parties that would prove that I have had proper supervision every day of the week during said periods." 

Bruce, by this point, has leaned back in his chair, looking equal parts surprised and amused. Tim isn’t sure that’s a good sign. 

“I’m not willing to go quietly, if it comes to that, Mr. Wayne. That’s all,” he finishes, and waits for the verdict. 

“Well,” says Bruce, after a moment. “That was certainly thoroughly thought out. You’ve been planning for this for a while, I assume?” Tim nods, and finally allows himself the coughing fit he’s been suppressing. Maybe it’ll give him bonus sympathy points from Bruce. 

Who is he kidding? This is Batman. 

“I’m impressed,” Bruce says. He leans forward a bit. “But that wasn’t necessary, Tim.”

_What?_ Tim’s brain grinds to a halt. What?

“I wasn’t planning on contacting CPP—at least, not right now. Partly for some of the very reasons you mentioned a few minutes ago. Your situation is definitely not usual, you’re correct. Your parents aren’t around at the moment to have any kind of discussion with. And, as you have demonstrated consistently over the course of time we’ve known you so far, you _are_ a very independent young adult, with self-sufficiency that many full-grown adults could learn a thing or two from.”

Tim senses a _but_ coming.

“But,” says Bruce, “By all rights, I legally _should_ . Despite your admittedly well-crafted arguments to the contrary, you’re technically a neglect case, because if something was to happen to you—_something like you getting sick enough to be unable to care for yourself,_ say—there’s no one around consistently to help in that situation. You’ve been lucky so far.”

Tim huffs quietly, but keeps silent.

“So what I _propose_,” Bruce says, pinning Tim with one of his intense looks, “is a compromise.” He’s got Tim’s rapt attention now. “When do your parents return, exactly?”

“I told you, sometime around the end of February,” Tim says. 

“They didn’t give you an exact date?”

“Sometimes they do, but they usually end up delayed a bit anyway. It’s easier to just know a ballpark estimate, and hear from them when they’re literally on their way home.”

“Hm,” says Bruce. “All right, so we’ll say last week of February. It’s mid-December now, and you and Jason start winter break in a week. You’re already staying with us until you’re fully recovered, and _yes_, I know you could technically take care of yourself if you go back now, but that’s not the point.” 

“What is the point?”

“I want you to stay here, at the manor, with us. Until your parents come home, and Alfred and I can speak with them about our concerns and see if something can be worked out where you’re properly taken care of _without_ needing to get CPP involved.”

“You—stay at—_here?_ ” Tim squeaks out. “You want me…”

“To live with us, yes,” Bruce says mildly. 

“Just like that?”

“Just like that.”

“But I have a _house_,” Tim protests. “And a life.”

“You’re not a prisoner.” Bruce laughs. “You can live with us and still do what you normally do. I know I’m not your actual guardian—though you don’t have much supervision anyway so that’s mostly a moot point. This way, you at least won’t have to feed yourself all the time, and Alfred, Jason, and I won’t be worried all the time about you being alone in that house with no company and no one to help if something is wrong.”

“I have your phone numbers.”

“Which you still haven’t used,” Bruce points out. “I’m not above using Jason against you, just so you know. He loves you. And he’s been lonely over here, since Dick moved into his own place. You’d be doing him a favor by staying here, and do _me_ a favor by keeping him out of at least some of the trouble he cooks up to avoid boredom.”

“But I can’t just barge into your life. I don’t want to intrude.”

_“Tim,”_ and Bruce leans in, nearly closing the gap between the armchair and Tim’s blanket burrito. “You’re being invited. We want you here, because we like you, and because I want to know that you’re safe. It would be my pleasure to have you stay with us for a while.”

Tim is silent for a while, processing that. Trying to decide if Bruce truly means what he says, or if he’s just saying what he should in order to get Tim to agree. He wants so badly for it to be true, but Tim has learned over the years that it’s better to keep his hopes low and wariness up so he doesn’t get as hurt when he’s inevitably let down. 

But Bruce is Batman, at the end of the day, and Batman has never shown himself to be untrustworthy. And right now, Bruce is speaking to Tim as Bruce, not in his Bruce Wayne Persona he puts on for the public. So maybe...maybe Tim can tentatively trust this. Enough to at least try, for a while.

“And if my parents aren’t happy about it?”

“I’ll deal with them,” Bruce assures. 

Tim doubts Bruce will deal with them the way that it needs to be done. His parents are touchy. Tim knows how to navigate their moods, but Bruce has only experienced their company manners. Fake smiles on the lips of all parties. It takes experience to avoid any land mines. But maybe if he makes sure he’s back living at home before his parents arrive next, it can work out all right. And anyway, it’s a problem for future Tim. 

“You’re really sure?” Tim asks, one more time.

“Absolutely.”

“And no CPP until we talk with my parents?”

“No CPP,” Bruce confirms. “And if someone else calls them, I’m already a certified foster parent in the system, and we could probably make a case for kinship care by saying I’m a family friend who already is a trusted presence in your life.”

“Okay,” Tim sighs, finally. “Thank you, Mr. Wayne. I appreciate your generosity.”

“Bruce, remember,” Bruce replies, with a smile. “Okay, Tim?”

“Bruce,” says Tim, smiling tentatively back. 

“FINALLY,” Jason nearly hollers as he slams the door open. “Gee _whiz_ , Timmers, I cannot believe it took you this long to agree. It’s gonna be like a never-ending sleepover, dude, it’s not that bad.”

“Were you listening the whole time?” Tim croaks out, heart still pounding from the sudden entrance. 

Jason shrugs. “Pretty much. What, you thought I’d actually stay away when an important conversation was happening?” Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose, tilting his face up to the rafters as is praying for patience. “ _Please_. It’s like you don’t even know me. 

Tim snorts, then realizes he does have another question, and looks shyly over at Bruce. “Um, do you...should I go home for Christmas?”

Bruce’s brow furrows slightly. “Why? Do you have relatives coming to town?”

“No, I just...I don’t want to intrude or anything. It’s family time, and I’m sure you have traditions and everything.”

“Our motto is the more the merrier,” says Jason. He flops down on the couch next to Tim. “We’re a hodgepodge family with hodgepodge holiday traditions that get shuffled around every year anyway. We can just add you in to the fun. If you want to go to church, Alfred drives whoever wants to go on Christmas morning, so don’t worry about that part. He’ll swing by more than one denomination’s church for drop-offs and pick-ups, too, if you’re not Episcopalian.”

“I, uh,” Tim says. “I’m actually Jewish?”

Jason blinks. “You are?” 

Tim nods. He hopes he didn’t misjudge. He doesn’t think the Waynes are prejudiced people, but people often don’t really know much about being Jewish, either, especially outside of the East End communities, and he really hopes he didn’t just make everything awkward. 

“What a coincidence,” says Bruce, and he’s got a genuine smile directed at Tim again. “So am I.”

“You…?” Tim gapes for a moment, the only thought running through his head a repeating chorus of _Batman is Jewish?!_ 

“Secular or religious?” Bruce is asking.

“Um. Mostly secular. We only really attend synagogue during the holidays. I watch livestreams on Fridays, sometimes, but that’s about it. We celebrate Christmas too, because Dad’s not Jewish, and he always wants us to have a tree around, and stuff. But Mom and I always do the eight nights—or, we do when she’s in town, anyway.”

Bruce nods. “I’m happy to take you with me when I go for Shabbat during the week of Hanukkah. It’s a shame we missed Rosh Hashanah, I’m always a bit uncomfortable attending alone. Maybe we can go together next year.”

“Yeah, maybe,” Tim agrees. He’s still reeling slightly.  

Dick chooses this moment to walk into the room on his hands, still in his uniform from work. “Oh, look, the gang’s all here!” he sing-songs. He’s got a grocery bag balanced on his feet, not even wobbling.

“Master Dick,” Alfred says, walking in behind him calmly, on two feet like a sensible human being. “I would like to remind you that while there are designated areas for you to employ your acrobatics, the main hallway _is not_, and _never has been_, one of them. On your feet, as is befitting of a proper young man.”

“Aw, Alfred, where’s the fun in that?” Dick complains, but he still flips upright, catching the bag with one hand and pecking a decidedly unmoved Alfred on the cheek. 

“Bold of you to assume any of us have ever been proper young men even one day in our lives,” Jason says, snorting. 

“There is always hope,” says Alfred, “no matter how hopeless a cause may seem.”

“Hey!”

_“Boys,”_ says Bruce, calmly, and the room magically settles. “I believe we’re due for some dinner. And then perhaps a movie, after?”

“No way,” Dick interjects. “I’ve got it covered this evening. We finally have enough people to make it worthwhile, so we’re going to play Warlocks and Warriors. I’m already set up to DM.”

Jason groans. 

Tim, however, lights up like a Christmas tree. Getting sick? It’s rapidly turning into one of the best things that’s happened to him in _months_. 

* * *

“ _Fine_,” Jason groans. All _right_. I won’t name him Tjfuptguh. Party pooper.”

Dick throws an arm out dramatically. “Oh, sorry, forgive me for needing to be able to pronounce my player’s character names, _Jeeson Pertwee Toddler._ ”

“Shut up.” Jason whacks Dick in the arm.

“I want to be a human rogue,” Tim says, around a mouthful of brownie. “Like Batman. _I am the night._ They’ll never see me coming.” 

“All right, sounds good. Roll for your stats,” Dick says, smiling at Tim and ignoring Jason’s rapidly escalating attempts to shove him off his dining room chair. 

Bruce looks up from his spot across the table, stops chewing absently on the pencil eraser he’s been tapping on his mouth. Frowns.

“I always thought Batman was more of a paladin,” he says. 

Tim’s eyes widen slightly. Oh, _this?_ This is golden. He can’t let on that he knows anything. Oh man.

“Bruce. No,” Dick says, not unkindly. “Are you kidding? Batman is the _essence_ of a neutral good rogue. _Superman_ is a lawful good paladin.” Bruce frowns more.

“What about Nightwing?” Tim pipes up. He can hardly hide his grin.

Dick doesn’t even blink. “Neutral good,” he says, no hesitation.

“Saint Bernard dog,” Jason says at the same time, and it’s Dick’s turn to whack him in the shoulder. 

“That’s not an alignment, stupid.”

“Be nice,” says Bruce, without any real bite. 

“And Robin?” Tim asks. 

Jason isn’t quite as good as Dick at hiding his emotions. He puffs out his chest just a little as he declares, firmly, “Chaotic good.” Dick and Bruce both nod without comment. 

“Interesting,” Tim murmurs. 

He can’t say he disagrees with them. Unfortunately, he’s inadvertently spun them off into an hour long debate over what every single Teen Titans and Justice League member would be classified as, including a five minute argument about whether Green Lantern would be a wizard or a druid, and a solid ten minutes deciding if Superboy should count already since he’s still figuring out parts of being a living person in general and doesn’t know all his _own_ views on things yet. 

Tim is still uncertain about how good an idea it is for him to stay with the Waynes, but everything so far is making him hopeful. As long as he doesn’t drop his guard and is able to keep up with the important things, maybe...it just might work out pretty well, honestly. And it’s certainly easier than having to manage operation Don’t Get Thrown Into Foster Care Before Mom And Dad Get Back by himself on top of school and BatWatch. It’s already a lot less lonely, at least (although he can’t admit that to Bruce).

And after all, he’s got time. It can’t hurt to stick around for a while and see how things go.
