#### Notes:

This chapter is a little rough, I didn't have much time to write today, so it might be re-edited later on and come out more polished. But here it is! And depending on if I'm snowed in at work tomorrow night without a laptop, I MAY or may not get the fic written and posted from my phone. If I don't get a chapter up, that's why lol 

**CONTENT WARNING: emotional child abuse, mild physical child abuse depending on what your standards are** 

Chapter title from H.S.K.T. by Sylvan Esso.

* * *

Ever since the Wayne household all found out Tim was the one behind BatWatch, Tim’s been having a hell of a time trying to actually get out at night and _do it_. He knows they’d all rather he stop completely, but no one outright told him a solid _no_ . Instead, they all dance around it in a sort of tango—Tim constantly finding new and exciting ways to sneak out at night, and Bruce, the boys, and _especially_ Alfred constantly foiling his plans. 

He only makes it out a couple times a week, now. (Tim’s pretty sure it’s because they’re letting him, just to keep him from running back to Drake Manor and the old unsupervised nights.)

And Bruce has kept his promise, even after the reveal. He still hasn’t called any authorities on Tim. If Bruce wasn’t Batman, Tim is pretty sure he would have called in a heartbeat the day after Christmas, but as it is, keeping tabs on Tim’s safety now that he’s aware of the issue is just small potatoes for the Bad. So that’s worked out great.

But since they all are _so determined_ to keep Tim home, the boys seem to have worked out a rotating schedule of who stays home all night to make sure Tim doesn’t just bolt once everyone is _“in bed for the night.”_ Because he _will_, and _has_, and they all know it at this point. Tim waited till three in the morning once, in the first couple of weeks, before scrambling out a  ballroom window. 

* * *

Tim hates—absolutely _hates—_ that their babysitting is keeping one of them off the streets at night more often than not. It’s killing him. He knows it’s his fault, because he won’t just promise to stop doing BatWatch. And he’s terrified that one of these nights, Batman and Robin will be out without Nightwing on the weekend, Batman and Nightwing out without Robin, or Batman out without either Robin at all, and something is going to happen. It’s only a matter of time. And it’s going to be Tim’s fault when it does. 

He can’t confront them about it, because they don’t know he _knows_. But he also can’t quite bring himself to _stop_. 

Out of all of them, Bruce seems to understand the most, because the second time Tim sneaks out for a night on the town, Batman finds him in an alley and gives him a Bat-print panic button bracelet. Tim has to fight not to smile.

“Use it. The very first second you think you need it.” Batman says. “I’ll always come. A mutual friend wants you to know someone’s here to keep an eye on you.”

“_You_ worry about the criminals,” Tim says, but he slips the bracelet on under his coat sleeve anyway. “_I’ll_ worry about myself.”

Batman grapples away, and Tim stays out for two more hours. Just to prove his point. 

Alfred and Bruce are still up and waiting with tea when he gets back to Wayne Manor. _Point taken,_ Tim concedes. But he can’t let himself get used to this life. He’s going home soon, back to his old routines and his parents and his big perfect house. He can’t get attached, no matter how good the tea is.

* * *

Tim’s parents come home on a Friday this time. 

When Tim gets the call that they’re on their way, he follows Bruce’s plan and tells them he’s over at Wayne Manor, which Jack and Janet seem fairly happy about. Gotham social ladder, and all that, Tim guesses. Bruce takes the phone, then, and asks if they’d be willing to speak with him when they come to get Tim.

Except—

Except Tim knows they _hadn’t_ been planning to swing by and pick up Tim. He was going to walk back over himself, or hitch a ride from one of the Waynes. And this was a terrible time to ask them to talk, much less to have a serious conversation that was probably going to make them upset. His parents got tired from traveling. Airports were stressful, and so was jetlag. You were supposed to leave them alone for the first day or two! 

Tim’s frantic _no! stop! abort!_ motions at Bruce go either ignored or unnoticed. Bruce’s high status and polite company manners force the Drakes to agree, politely, to _come right on by to have a chat, of course, we’d be delighted._ 

Tim vaguely wants to crawl into a hole and die.

“Bruce,” he says, a little frantically, as soon as Bruce hangs up and hands the phone back to Tim. “You can’t talk with them this soon. This is really bad timing. Can’t you wait a couple days?”

“Tim, we’ve waited for them for months,” Bruce says, frowning. “I know this is something you’d rather not ever talk about with them, but it’s important. Neglect is neglect. They need to understand what’s wrong about this, and if they need help learning or figuring out a safer plan to change your situation, I’m happy to help. Heaven knows that I know firsthand how unprepared adults often are to raise children. It’s not shameful to not know what you’re doing—only to refuse to learn and do better for your kid when you find out you’ve been wrong.”

“Bruce. _Please_,” Tim begs. “You don’t get what I’m saying. It’s not going to go well if we do this right now. It’ll—they’ll—it won’t work. You have to wait for the right time. I know how they work, what they’re like.” He pauses, takes a breath. “You can’t do it like this.”

“What _are_ they like, Tim?” Bruce’s eyes have sharpened, a bit of Batman shining through. 

Tim shrugs helplessly. 

“Tim. If there’s anything I should know before talking with them—”

“You should _wait!”_ Tim shouts, frustration flaring into anger so quickly it startles both of them. “You should _listen to me_ when I’m trying to tell you you’re doing this wrong! It’s going to be bad if you scold and threaten them now. It’s bad enough that you’re making them come get me instead of going straight home, I should head over early so that I’m there and everything’s normal anyway when they arrive.” 

Tim takes a few breaths, tries to calm down. “Their _image_. Their reputation is everything to them. We have to behave right, and look right, and do the right things. If you bring them in there when they’re already stressed out from traveling, and attack their decisions, it’s like...like—” Tim doesn’t know what he’s trying to say. 

Bruce’s expression is carefully neutral. Tim _hates_ it. 

“Never mind,” he snaps. “Forget it. Do what you want. I’m going to go pack my suitcase.”

He leaves Bruce’s study without a backward glance, temper already simmering down and being replaced by roiling guilt and shame. Tim didn’t _yell_ like that at people. Only his parents, and that was bad enough. Oh, god. He’d just yelled at _Bruce_. Bruce, who’s been nothing but good to him, and kind, and let him stay here for ages and mooch off of his money and hasn’t called CPP. 

He could take all of that away in a second. Maybe he’s calling CPP right now because he’s finally decided Tim’s too much of a problem. Or that Tim’s parents are too complicated to deal with. What if Tim gets taken away and never comes back to his school, or sees Jason again, or doesn’t get to go home or get his things or see his parents again? He doesn’t want that! 

_But no one cares what kids want,_ Tim thinks. _They want you to be responsible, but they don’t want to treat you like an adult. You just have to follow whatever they decide._ 

Tim makes it through ten minutes of half-hearted packing before he throws up in the bathroom toilet. He cleans himself up, brushes his teeth, and finishes packing. Then, suitcase in hand, he treks down the back stairs and out of the building, and heads over to Drake manor like he should have long before now. 

If he hurries, there’s just enough time to call his parents and make them come straight home, instead, as long as he can convince them Bruce had something come up.

* * *

He’s glad he went home. That first day, he manages to keep his parents happy, and everything actually goes fine. They eat dinner as a family, when Mrs. Mac tells them it’s ready. She doesn’t mention exactly how long Tim has been staying away from home, and Tim doesn’t tell his parents about it either, except to mention how close he and Jason have gotten through school, and how that’s why he was with the Waynes. 

“That’s _lovely_ , Tim,” his mom says, with a real smile. “I always worry about you, with how hard it’s been for you to make friends. Ever since Sebastian moved to Maine, I thought you might never find a new best friend.”

“Jason’s really great, Mom,” Tim says, more brightly than before. “He’s really funny, and kind. And he’s super into books, too. I think he might end up being a writer someday. He’s always at the top of his English classes.”

“And he’s a boy of good standing, despite his less than ideal origins,” his mother agrees. “You’re doing a _wonderful_ job of networking, sweetheart. I hope the two of you become good friends.”

“Thanks, Mom. Me too.” Tim can’t help beaming. 

* * *

Three hours later, she screams back and forth with him over his jacket being left out in the foyer. He knows it’s not about the jacket, really. She’s tired, and she doesn’t really know how to deal with a teenage son, and she’s always really serious about her house being completely clean. It’s one of her few rules, and he did break it. 

But it still hurts, being yelled at, and it hurts in an even _worse_ way to be the one doing an equal share of the yelling. It never makes him feel any better. But despite his best intentions, when he’s being yelled at, Tim can’t help but holler back, and then they’re BOTH off and running. No one ever wins from there. 

Tim goes to bed that night with a sigh, and swipes away the seventeen missed notifications from Bruce and Dick. Jason, he replies to with a simple, _Settling back in. Talk to you soon._

Tim lies down wedged into the corner between lots of pillows, and doesn’t even try to sneak out that night. 

* * *

The next morning, Tim and his father share companionable silence in the breakfast nook by a window. They each have a coffee, warm and steaming. Jack catches up on articles, or maybe emails, on a tablet. Tim has homework spread around. As he scribbles down another part of a formula on a neon green index card, he’s surprised when Jack asks, “What are you working on, Tim?”

“Huh?” Tim blinks, looking up at his dad across the table. “Oh, this? It’s for my computational analysis class. It’s one of my electives for the year. I figured it would be good preparation for college.”

“Computational analysis, huh?” His dad smiles, takes a sip of coffee. “Sounds complicated.”

“Sometimes,” Tim agrees. “But honestly, it’s so interesting, I don’t even mind when it’s hard. We get to do the _coolest_ things. Everything in this class is about practical applications, you know? Instead of just doing statistics for the sake of stupid statistics.”

“Hey, now,” Jack says, pointing his coffee at Tim in mock dismay. “You know, some of us actually like math. Maybe even majored in it, at one point.”

“Sorry.” Tim says. “But you know I’m not math’s biggest fan.”

“Truly, a great sorrow.”

“But,” Tim adds. “If every math class were like this one, I think you might be able to convert me to the dark side.”

“Wow,” his dad says. “Must be really interesting, then. What is it right now?”  
Tim hesitates. 

But...his dad seems like he really wants to know. This is exactly what Tim’s been hoping for, right? He wants them to be closer. He wants to get to know his dad, and be known by him. It’s never going to happen if Tim doesn’t take those difficult first steps, too. 

“We’re making a mathematical model of how a virus gets transmitted during an epidemic,” he says, dragging his chair around to his dad’s side. He pulls some of his notes with him, points to a large diagram he’s made. “See? You have these different groups of people—infected non-symptomatic, symptomatic, recovered, dead, non-infected, right? And the virus can be transmitted in certain ways. And if you’re tracking an outbreak, you know certain times and rates. You know how many hours or days it takes for symptoms to start, and then for a progression to happen. And you know how many people seem to get sick once the virus reaches an area, and different factors that affect all of that.” 

He gestures at his numerous index cards spread out across the table. “So you can take all those pieces, and tie them together using the rates, which tell you how many people in an hour, or day, or week, are moving from, say, the symptomatic category to the dead category, and the symptomatic category to the recovered immune category, and you can make these equations.”

“And the equations help you model what’s going on?”

“Exactly!” Tim grins at his dad. “Except instead of just showing what’s already happening, when we build these equations, we can use them to try to predict statistically what will happen next. Who’s the most vulnerable? When will the peak of infections be? How long could this epidemic last, if you quarantine the area? What if you have new people constantly coming in on planes and other transportation from other areas?”

“That’s really interesting.” Jack sounds like he means it. “Have you gotten the model set up for this one yet?”

“No,” Tim says, smile falling. “I got stuck. I’m working on it.”

“Want me to take a look? I may not be an analyst anymore, but I don’t think I’ve forgotten quite everything I learned back then.”

Tim’s eyes widen. “Really? You want to have a go at it?”

And Jack _does_. He and Tim spend at least twenty minutes working together on Tim’s homework, and fix two errors Tim hadn’t caught. It’s one of the best mornings he’s had in ages. 

* * *

His parents are good people; he knows that. They’re good to Tim. Yeah, they fight with him sometimes, but it does take two to tango. Tim’s no paragon of calm and even-temperedness himself. 

Sure, Jack and Janet aren’t around much, and yeah, he’s got to be careful of their moods. But they’re _good_ people, at their cores, and they care a lot about moral causes, and fight for the underpaid workers they encounter, and have funded several initiatives to get artifacts stolen from civilizations still in existence returned. They’ve got _good hearts_ . Tim and his parents have just...not been quite sure how to get to know each other, over the years. _But that can change,_ Tim thinks. _And it will. It is, already._  

They just have to take it one step at a time. 

* * *

Then Bruce Wayne shows up at their house that afternoon. All Tim can think is _oh no. Not now._ Things were going _well_. 

Tim avoids Bruce the whole time he’s there.

* * *

Bruce is gone, but the mood in Drake Manor has soured. Tim had been looking forward to a nice evening with his parents, but that definitely isn’t  going to happen anymore. His suggestion that they watch a movie together is instantly shot down, and Tim decides silence is his safest option for the rest of dinner.

Not long after, he and Jack are shouting at each other. Except it’s more Jack shouting Tim down than anything else, after a few minutes. All over a stupid comment that _stupid_ Tim had made about the _stupid_ Waynes. 

And Tim is shouting at his father, hot and flushed and heart pounding in his chest like a runaway drum line, and his father is towering over him while Tim finds himself backed up against the counter. 

“You think that pompous ass of a man is better than your own mom and dad, do you?” Jack shouts. “Give him the _audacity_ to think that he can come in here and tell us how to parent you better? As if he knows you at all, from a few months of playdates, when we’ve had you your whole _life?_ ” 

Tim flinches. Jack takes another step forward. There’s a vein visible in his forehead now, and his face is just as flushed as Tim’s own. Janet watches from the side, not participating, but not leaving either.

Jack jabs a finger at Tim. “You ungrateful little _brat!_ We feed you, clothe you, house you, pay for all your schooling and activities all these years, give you _everything_ you ever need or want, and you diss us like this? What, are you suddenly too scared to stay by yourself in a house with state-of-the-art-security now? Or maybe you want Wayne to take you in like he did with those two charity case gold diggers of his.”

“Leave Dick and Jason out of this!” Tim can’t help yelling back. “They didn’t do anything wrong. Just because you feel like I’m dissing you and mom doesn’t mean I _am!_ I didn’t ask Mr. Wayne to do that! But you know what, if you want me to answer you honestly, he probably knows me better right now than either of you do. It’s not like you’re ever actually _here!”_

Tim’s head snaps backwards and to the side, and he teeters into the counter, countertop edge digging into his ribs. His mother is inches away, furious. 

“Don’t you dare speak to us like that,” she hisses. “We’re your _parents_, Timothy Jackson Drake. You are out of control!” 

“I’m sorry,” Tim says, stunned. “But—”

His mother slaps him again. 

He stands still for a few more minutes of his father shouting, and apologizes two more times. This time without any conditionals tacked on. 

As soon as he can, he escapes up to his room and locks the door. His face feels like lava where his mother’s palm had landed, and he wonders where exactly he’s gone so wrong. He needs to keep that from happening again. 

He’s got to be a better son.

* * *

Tim avoids Jason in school all monday, skipping lunch again like he did back in December. He finds a granola bar shoved through the slats of his locker when he opens it that afternoon, and it’s the first thing that’s made him want to smile all day. 

Tim slogs through classes, through yearbook club, through the walk home. But that evening, he texts Jason. They talk about nothing in particular for a while, just light conversation. Jason invites him over the next day. Tim declines.

_Everything okay over there?_ Jason asks, as Tim is getting ready for bed. _Bruce and Alfie and I miss you. And Bruce says he hasn’t heard anything from your parents, but they were supposed to contact him._

Bruce. Bruce Bruce Bruce. 

Bruce, who held Tim while he cried, and brought him to his own home, but who also ruined the good thing Tim had going with his parents for once. Now, they’re not going to trust Tim again for years. The house is filled with cold silence. Tim knows the ins and outs of the silent treatment well, but that doesn’t make it any less awful each time.

_It’s fine,_ Tim says, even though it’s absolutely not. _You can tell Bruce to stop trying to interfere and mind his own business for once. I don’t need more help._ He pauses for a moment, then adds _My parents are still **here**, aren’t they?_ and hits _send_ before he can second-guess the nasty tone in everything he just wrote. 

Tim shoves his phone off the side of the bed, then pulls a pillow over his face. 

It takes him a long time to fall asleep.

* * *

When he wakes up in the morning to get ready for school, there’s one text from Jason lighting up his lockscreen. 

_I’ll back off. Sorry. And I’ll keep Bruce off your tail too, for a while. I miss you, dude. If I promise not to pry unless you want to talk about something, will you please eat lunch with me again?_ 

Tim sighs. He misses Jason, too. A lot. There’s a hole in his days where Jason has been for so many weeks now, at breakfasts, popping around doorways, playing games, offering book recommendations. Tim misses it all.

_I’m sorry too,_ he types. _I’ve been kind of a jerk, and you don’t deserve that. And yeah. It’s a deal._

* * *

So Jason and Tim hang out at school, but Tim doesn’t go back to Wayne Manor, and he doesn’t go out at night. BatWatch announces it’s on an indefinite hiatus. 

This, unfortunately, makes the nightly news, and Tim is graced with a solid ten minutes of complaining from his parents about lawless vigilantes and the fool (or fools) who have been needlessly endangering themselves for so long just to follow them. 

“If they really are hurt and out of commission, then good riddance,” Janet says. “Maybe that will finally teach them to not take that kind of risk just for attention and fame.”

Tim tries not to let it sting. 

* * *

And life goes on. Tim goes to school, hangs with Jason, sees Dick on weekends when they all go out to a diner, or skate park, or the movies. His parents work at Drake Industries and spend free time at home. Both he and his parents are all the more miserable for it. 

Tim gets good grades. His parents nod. They move on, weaving around each other in the giant pristine house, and it’s strange how it feels just as empty as before even with two more bodies walking the halls. 

Then on the second Thursday after his parents have returned to Gotham, Tim is tired and frustrated after a hard math test. He responds to his father’s request with the hint of an attitude in his tone, and both of them are primed and ready for a fight, and everything just _explodes_ from there. 

It ends several minutes later in Tim’s room, with the TV ripped out of the wall and thrown into the hallway, and Tim’s $600 wide-angle camera lens crushed under Jack’s loafer. Tim can do nothing but stare. The plastic and glass shards are scattered around the carpet like blood droplets crystalized, and Jack is _still_ angry, and Tim doesn’t know what else Jack _wants_ from him. He doesn’t know what to do anymore. He doesn’t even really care. There’s a black hole devouring his chest, deep among his ribs, and Tim just doesn’t _know_.

Jack drags him downstairs, out the back door, and locks it in Tim’s face. He’s ordered to stay out there until he’s cooled down. Tim hears the alarm system beep as it’s turned on, and knows that his chances of getting back in through a different door or window have just gone down to nil. 

Tim waits several minutes, and his anger does vanish quickly. He has no jacket or coat, nothing to keep him from feeling the sharp bite of the late February cold. It’s hard to focus on a petty argument with wind biting through his shirtsleeves. 

He’s got space and time, now, to breathe, and calm. He regrets his own shouting. He’s definitely ready to apologize. But when he calls for Jack, knocks on the door, his father still doesn’t let him back in. He won’t believe Tim is ready to behave. 

Tim sits back down on the stone steps. The cycle repeats three times. 

After the last time, something inside Tim just...shuts down. _It doesn’t matter,_ he realizes. _It doesn’t matter anymore. I can’t make him happy._ 

He’s got no coat, no hat, no gloves. No food. No money. 

He does have his phone, though. 

And he has someone who has come for him when he’s called. Someone who’s come every time Tim has needed him in the past few months, and a couple times even when he didn’t. Someone who didn’t give up on Tim, or kick him out. Even when Tim has been more trouble than he’s worth. Even when Tim yelled at him. Even when he knew Tim didn’t want it. Because he didn’t want Tim to be alone. 

Tim stands up. It doesn’t matter if his dad lets him in or not. He doesn’t care. He starts walking across the lawn, towards the property line. No one calls out after him from the house. 

Tim pulls out his phone, and with shaking fingers, he dials Bruce. 

“Hello?” Bruce answers after a single ring. “Tim? Are you all right?”

There’s a pause. Tim tries to find his voice.

“Tim?” Bruce asks again. Concerned.

_“Bruce,”_ Tim gets out finally. “Bruce.”

“What’s going on, Tim?”

“He locked me _out_,” Tim whispers. “I’m s-s-so cold. _Bruce_.”

“I’m here, buddy,” and there’s noise in the background, shoes hitting hard floor. “Where are you?”

“Bruce,” Tim chokes out, because he’s _so_ _sorry_. He can hear a door slamming, and wind, now. Tim’s been nothing but cruel to Bruce since he left. And now he’s calling him out of nowhere, with another problem to add on top of all the others, as if Bruce didn’t have enough to worry about. But Tim just wants to feel _safe_ again. He wants to come _home_.

“Tim, I see you. I see you. I’m almost there.”

The line cuts out, and Tim drops the phone in his pocket as Bruce is coming near, sprinting across the grass. Then they’re colliding, and Bruce’s arms are the best thing Tim has felt in weeks, and he’s being hugged tighter than maybe ever before. 

“I’m sorry,” Tim cries into Bruce’s button up. The man didn’t even have a sportcoat on. “I’m sorry, I was so mean, I’m sorry I yelled at you, I’m sorry I said—”

“Shhhh,” Bruce tells him, fingers running gently along the back of Tim’s head. “I’ve got you. You don’t need to apologize. It’s okay.”

“It’s not,” Tim nearly wails, and then he’s sobbing so hard he can’t speak. And Bruce is still there.

Tim doesn’t know if he’s shaking more from the heaving sobs or the bitter cold, but either way Bruce scoops him up like a kid and starts to walk. Tim’s arms loop around Bruce’s neck, and his legs wrap around his waist, and he clings to Bruce like a koala as they make their way across the grass. 

“I’m sorry I called,” Tim mumbles, as they’re reaching Wayne Manor. “Didn’t want to cause more problems.”

“Tim,” Bruce says firmly. “You’re not a problem. You’re a wonderful young man. And I’m glad you called me, and I’m glad you’re back with us. We missed you.”

Tim sniffs.

“Although,” Bruce adds, “I’m sorry it’s under these circumstances. I was really hoping your parents would work things out.”

“Master Bruce!” Alfred exclaims as they come in the back door. “I’ll get a kettle going.”

Bruce sets Tim down in one of the kitchen chairs, then crouches down to look him right in the eyes. Tim looks down. Bruce’s hand cups Tim’s chin, tilts his gaze back up. 

“Tim.” 

Tim looks. 

“You can always call me,” Bruce says. “Day or night, happy or sad, you can call me, and I’m going to come. I’ll tell you that as many times as you need to hear it to believe me. I’ll come every time. I’m happy to do it. You’re important, Tim, not just to me, but period. I want to know you’re happy, and healthy, and safe.”

“Okay,” Tim says, and he doesn’t totally believe Bruce yet, not all the way, but he’s _trying_. He’s trying.

“It’s going to be okay.” Bruce pulls Tim in for another hug, while Alfred wraps Tim in one of the throws from the lounge. “We’re going to make everything okay.”

Tim closes his eyes. And maybe, just a little, he’s starting to believe that.

#### Notes:

I know this was a really heavy chapter, sorry. I promise we're hitting an upswing from here on out! It gets better! 

Also the weather is SHIT tomorrow morning is going to be a miserable drive to work and I may end up iced and snowed in there overnight. IF I DO I will write even more, so at least there's that. I hope you're all safe and warm and hydrated and happy!
