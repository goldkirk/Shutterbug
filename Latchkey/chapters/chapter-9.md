# unconditionally cared for by those who share our broken hearts

> Hanukkah, Christmas, and secrets, oh my!

#### Notes:

I Am So Sorry This Is Late, today was so busy like omg (chicken wrangling and knife sharpening went fine, and I GOT TO HOLD A RAINBOW PYTHON SHE WAS SO SWEET). But I DID IT, I got it written, and made myself emotional. I hope I did these scenes justice!

**CONTENT WARNING:** some child abuse is hinted at vaguely, and neglect is mentioned in offhand ways.

Chapter title is from Snow, by Sleeping At Last, which is the theme song for this whole chapter.

* * *

This time last year, Tim was alone and carefully setting up a little ten dollar hanukkiah from Target in his bedroom window. He could’ve gotten out his mother’s, set it up in a window downstairs. But without her there, it just...didn’t feel right. Hanukkah was a holiday to be celebrated in your home, with family and friends, remembering a joyous miracle, and with no one else around...it was hard to feel much of the spirit and light. So Tim contented himself with a quiet observation of the holiday, and ate McDonald’s hash browns reheated while singing quietly as he lit the tiny candles for each night.

But now, Tim is in the largest front facing room of Wayne Manor, next to Bruce Wayne himself. Dick, Jason and Mr. Pennyworth have joined them, even, standing a few paces back from the window. The room is full of light, and voices, and Dick’s laughter rings out following something Alfred says. Jason elbows Dick in the ribs, and Bruce hides a slight smile as he opens a new box of matches. 

Last year, Tim’s first night of Hanukkah was dark, cold, and more lonely than he wanted to admit. Now, all he feels is warmth. 

“It’s time,” Bruce says, when his watch alarm goes off, and everyone quiets. The faintest glow still rests just above where the Sun has fallen down below the horizon, and paints the sky a deep and vibrant purple. Tim wishes he could capture it forever on his camera, this painted landscape behind Bruce’s intricate old Hanukkah menorah. 

“Tim?” Bruce says, pulling him out of his thoughts. “Do you want to do the honors?”

Tim freezes for a moment, brain feeling like a sparking circuit board. He’s not the head of this house. And he was _technically_ head of _his_ house last year, since there was no one else in it, and it wasn’t really all that great. It was—well. He kind of wants someone else to take care of things, for once. Wasn’t that what he’d told Bruce the other night, after all?

“Thank you, but...I’d rather you do it,” Tim says quietly. Bruce’s smile is warm, no hint of disappointment to be found.

“Okay,” he says, and then his hand is around Tim’s shoulders as he walks them both up to the window. 

Bruce hands the first candle to Tim, who carefully slots it into the first branch on the rightmost side of their hanukkiah. Then Bruce recites the first blessing, and the second, and Tim is in love with the way the Hebrew sounds in the quiet chant. Bruce’s voice is not particularly beautiful, but it’s deep, and solid, and for Tim it is inherently tied to the safety and awe of Batman in his mind. Bruce is a pillar in their world. And now he’s reciting the blessings Tim’s mother could not come home to say herself, in her own house, and Tim is afraid to let himself wonder if she’s even actually reciting them at all. 

_It isn’t the time to think poorly of others,_ he chides himself, and then relaxes into the last lines of the second blessing as Bruce’s careful diction fills the silent room. 

Because it is the first night, Tim joins Bruce in reciting the Shehechiyanu blessing, and then everyone in the room joins in to sing _Maoz Tzur_ except Tim. His mother has never included anything further in their candle lighting rituals. Maybe he can ask Jason to teach it to him later tonight, so he would know for the future. 

When the song is over and the candle is lit, and the shamash nestled safely in it’s center branch, Alfred claps once.

“And now,” he says, breaking into a smile, “we eat.”

“I call first,” Jason shouts, and he’s sprinting for the hallway. 

“YOU GOT FIRST _LAST_ YEAR, YOU CAN’T TAKE HALF THE PILE AGAIN,” Dick hollers at Jason’s back, and then he’s off and running too. 

Bruce shakes his head, and puts a hand on Tim’s shoulder as they walk at the pace of normal human beings. “Sorry about them,” he says. “Alfred’s latkes only come once a year, and somewhere along the line Hanukkah in this house turned into a contest to see who can try to squirrel away the most latkes to be frozen and hidden from the others. As if Alfred would ever let them stay hidden that way.”

“Indeed,” Alfred agrees, glancing over his shoulder at them. “If I allowed the boys to succeed, the treat would no longer be as special. _For everything there is a season,_ the Bible says, and _never_ is that more true than in matters of food and the unflagging mischief of young adults.” 

Then Alfred is in the kitchen, sternly telling Jason to _get down from that refrigerator, young sir, and try to maintain at least some propriety during the Festival of Lights, if you please,_ and also _that does not excuse you, Master Dick, from your appalling attempt to consume four latkes at once, settle_ **_down._** Tim stops entirely in his tracks a few paces from the door, overwhelmed suddenly by the sheer amount of life in the house. He’s spent so long in such a slow-moving home, where silence was the rule and every creak and draft was known and expected, and order was kept unfailingly. 

The chaos here is normally a welcome difference. But tonight, suddenly, Tim is struck by panic in the hallway, and he wants nothing more than to flee for his house with its silent kitchen and empty rooms, and it’s so _stupid_ , because he doesn’t even know _why_ . He’d just be miserable there, alone and quiet and always left behind—and Tim wants to _stop_ now, just stop thinking, stop being here, stop realizing things. 

He was _fine_ before he started hanging around the Waynes. He was perfectly fine with the way things were. Why does everything have to be so confusing now?

Bruce, apparently, has stopped with him, because there are hands cupping Tim’s face, and Bruce is crouched to meet Tim at eye level, calm and steady and so, so careful. Tim doesn’t understand, doesn’t get it, he’s so frustrated that these things keep happening. The touch on his face shouldn’t be making his eyes well up hot and damp. Brothers singing _Hanukkah Oh Hanukkah_ off-key in someone else’s kitchen shouldn’t make his chest tight like it will never expand again. He shouldn’t be freaking out in a hallway for _no reason at all._  

And Bruce is telling him _Breathe, Tim, it’s all right. Just breathe in, like this,_ and Tim’s eyes shutter closed. He tries so hard to breathe with Batman, slowly, calm. In and out, one thing at a time. _You’re alright,_ Batman says, _it’s alright,_ and Tim leans his head into Bruce’s shoulder and just breathes. 

* * *

They don’t talk about Tim’s brief freak out afterwards, just head into the kitchen for latkes and some truly _incredible_ Nutella rugelach that melts in Tim’s mouth. 

“Sour cream is best,” Bruce says, at one point, and Alfred groans. 

Every year. They do this every year, without fail, and _every year_ it goes exactly the same way. Bruce staunchly stands by his belief that dipping latkes in sour cream is the only true way to eat them, thanks to his father’s influence long ago. Then Jason will counter with applesauce, and Dick inevitably disgusts them both by insisting that they might as well dip the latkes in ketchup since they’re glorified hashbrowns anyway, and gets himself promptly banished from the kitchen for several minutes. Except _this_ year, one small thing is different. 

“I always prefer applesauce,” Tim says, his first words since entering the kitchen. “It’s a nice balance to the flavor and oil, I think. Fresh. Makes me feel less like I’m deep frying my insides.”

The other three go silent. Alfred struggles not to laugh from over by the counter. 

Bruce looks mildly betrayed, one eyebrow slowly lifting at Tim as if to say _et tu, Brute?_ Dick’s eyes roll as he pointedly dunks his fourth latke in a dish of ketchup. And Jason, after a few moments of open-mouthed staring, punches his fist into the air so hard he lifts up from his seat. 

_“Yes,”_ he crows, turning to point at Bruce. “Two for applesauce! You’re beat, old man, I win!”

Bruce buries his face in his hands, and Jason hauls a bemused Tim out of his seat into an impromptu dance full of spins with _Hanerot Halalu_ playing over the kitchen speaker in the background. 

It is, by far, the weirdest, craziest Hanukkah night Tim has ever had. But good. Warm. Hallway breakdown aside, Tim might get used to this. It’s nice, having people, and light, and laughter this year. 

* * *

Two nights later, it’s Christmas Eve, and despite what was likely vehement protest from Agent A, Batman, Robin, and Nightwing are out on patrol in the frosty night. 

And since they’re out, so is Tim. 

* * *

“You all deserve the night off,” Alfred had said to Bruce earlier in the day. 

“Maybe,” Bruce replied. “But it’s the very last night, Alfred. People deserve to be safe while going home for Christmas.”

* * *

Tim doesn’t need to have overheard the quiet exchange to guess that something along those lines had been said. Regardless of what exactly had been decided about patrol, the Bats met up with Batgirl, currently home for winter break, and mostly perched themselves at a few key spots to make sure no funny business happened around the bus and train stops. 

Tim kept a low profile, as always, and snapped a few particularly fun shots of Nightwing and Batgirl pranking Robin several times, and nearly scaring him over the edge of a roof before Batman put an end to it. 

Now Tim has settled down on a mostly empty townhouse rooftop to capture a shot of Batman against the night sky whenever he pauses on a gargoyle or corner in Tim’s line of sight. Tim plans to photoshop a santa hat on Batman later tonight and post it as BatWatch’s annual Christmas card of sorts. 

Then he loses Batman. 

Tim blinks, frowning. Yeah, he’s lost Batman plenty of times before. But usually it’s because something’s happening, and Batman needed to go stop it. Tim only looked down at his camera screen for a moment, to check the settings. As far as he knows, nothing new is going on in the general area. 

Tim shoves his camera deep in his backpack. He’ll drift a bit, see if he can catch up to the Bats again, and if he hasn’t had any luck in fifteen minutes or so, he’ll just call it a night. 

It’s been a few rounds of rooftop jumping and careful scrambling across a few chicken coop areas when Tim stops for a moment to survey the area, decide which way to go next. He’s just about caught his breath and decided to head north towards his usual bus stop, dip out for the night.

“Isn’t it a little late for you to be out?” Batman’s voice says from behind him, and Tim is not ashamed to say that a genuine shriek came out of his mouth in that moment.

He whips around, wide eyes thankfully hidden behind deep brown contacts. Tim’s heart races like a jackhammer, and he’s flying through a checklist— _camera is tucked away, so that’s good, although if he saw me taking photos earlier and that’s why he’s here then the jig might be up, oh god, please don’t recognize me from the night with Scarecrow, I hope my outfit is different enough, and I chose curly black hair this time, please don’t recognize me, please don’t recognize me, how is this happening._

“What are you doing out tonight?” Batman asks. He doesn’t sound angry, or particularly suspicious. Maybe a little concerned, if anything. 

“I’m—uh. Uh…” Tim loses his voice for several eternal seconds.

“Are you running away?” And there’s that undercurrent of kindness, that strong compassion, deep in Batman’s voice, exactly what Tim started all of this to make sure people _saw_ . 

“Uh,” Tim says, throat surprisingly tight. “Yes. Yeah, I am. Running away. Sir.” He gulps. 

Batman nods once, slowly. Then he turns and sits right down on one of the roof’s exhaust vent structures. 

“Come sit down for just a minute,” he says, gesturing to the other one several feet away. “Let’s talk about it.”

Tim sits.

Batman leans forward, just a bit. “What’s wrong? What are you running from? It must be pretty lousy if you’re making a break for it on Christmas Eve, of all days.”

“It’s not…” Tim scrambles, trying so hard to find something, _anything_ to say that would work. His entire brain is nothing but Kill Bill sirens at this point. “I—I—” 

Batman is siting across from him, huge and dark and safe, but _overwhelming_ , all that attention and energy on him like a laser, and Tim just can’t think like this, not with how completely sudden and unexpected it all is. Not alone on a rooftop with Batman himself. 

Batman seems to get that. He’s saying something, quietly. _Into a hidden comm,_ Tim thinks, _that is so cool._ 

“It’s all right,” Batman says to him. Sets his hands carefully on his spread knees, posture loose. “Hang on.”

And then Robin lands on the roof with a flip, just to show off, and Tim hates it and loves it and curses his own stupid hubris in every language he knows.

Robin clearly doesn’t recognize him any more than Batman does, but clearly _does_ recognize that this is a Delicate Situation, because instead of Jason’s usual bold I’m-here-deal-with-it body language, he’s taming himself into something more quiet, lessening any threat. 

“Runaway, huh?” Robin says gently. 

Tim wonders how bad a job he’s done with this damn disguise if Batman and Robin just instantly assume he’s young enough to be a kid running away. He’s knows he’s on the small side, but _come on._

“You know,” Robin goes on, and Batman is turned slightly, clearly watching his partner while still keeping a side eye on Tim. “I was on my own too, for a while. At home, at first, but then on the streets for real. I didn’t trust anyone then. But listen. Someone helped me, for real, when I finally let them in a bit after they refused to give up on me. And it’s not like everything in my life is sunshine and daisies and perfect story endings, but dude—there are people who will care for you and want you to be happy. And who will want to spend time with you, just because you’re you, and love you, and really try to make life good for you. They’ll value you for who you are. There are people you can exist with just as you are without changing a single thing, or having to be afraid all the time. I know it probably sounds impossible right now, but there _are_ .”

What is going _on_ tonight?

“You’re not as alone as you feel you are,” Robin says, firmly, after a pause. “You deserve to feel safe, and cared for, and valued and appreciated and loved. You’re really important, kid.”

And Tim. 

Tim.exe has stopped working. What the fuck. What the hell. This is. What? He just wanted to _photograph_ _Batman_, how did this turn into some kind of therapy session on a dirty roof with Batman and Robin in the early morning hours of Christmas? He should have just stayed home. Like, _home_ home, way back when, he should be in his empty house right now where at least he understood how things worked and who he was and what he was expected to do. This is completely out of his league. 

“Listen,” Tim says, and wow, is that his voice that’s so croaky? “I appreciate it and all, but really I’m fine. Don’t you guys have crime you need to fight, and like, important stuff to do? You can go.”

Batman’s gaze is still hidden behind the white lenses in his cowl, but Tim has never been more sure of anything in his life than he is the fact that at that moment Batman is looking him _straight_ in the eyes. 

“You’re more important,” says Batman, without a trace of insincerity. “I want to be sure you’re safe and okay tonight.”

Tim, to his horror, suddenly finds tears running down his cheeks, and shit, shit, these contacts were brand new, he can’t mess them up yet, and oh no, here he goes, there’s the sob. He wants to tell them, so badly, that it’s him. He wants to know if they’d still say all of that if they knew who was under the wig, the contacts, the _lies_ . He wants to know if they really mean _him_ . He wants to come clean right now. 

He’s so _tired_ . But he just...he can’t. 

The next thing he knows, he’s getting a hug from Robin, and then from Batman, and this is so _stupid_ because he’s not even running away, the whole thing is a great big lie, but Tim can’t stop _hiccuping_ and Batman is like, rubbing his back and making little shushing noises, and this is quickly becoming one of the top three weirdest nights of Tim’s life.

* * *

Once Tim has calmed down somewhat from his frankly embarrassing weep-a-palooza, Robin hands him some Kleenex. 

“Can we take you somewhere safe for the night?” Batman asks. “They don’t ask any questions there, and you don’t have to pay. They’ll let kids and teens stay so they’re off the streets, and no predators or gangs get in. We make sure of it.”

And, well. Tim’s options here are to either confess or go, and his window of opportunity to fess up is well past. In for a penny, in for a pound, Tim supposes.

“Do they need names?” he checks, as Batman and Robin climb down the nearest fire escape alongside him. 

“No. And if anyone comes looking for you, this place won’t say a word about if they’ve seen or heard of you ever. In case you were worried about that.”

“Okay,” says Tim, and that’s not what he’s worried about. His problem is pretty much the polar opposite of that. He wonders how long it would even take his parents to have a clue he was gone, if he was kidnapped or something, since they don’t listen to school messages anyway. Probably a good while. 

He’s silent the rest of the way to the youth shelter, where he politely thanks Batman and Robin and heads inside. He stays hidden just long enough so they’ll think he’s checking in for the night, then sneaks back out and calls an Uber to take him to Drake Manor. 

He needs some space to think.

* * *

But this time? This time, Tim sends Bruce a text saying he’s going home for the night, and he’ll be back. So Bruce doesn’t worry. 

Small steps. 

* * *

Tim spends maybe minutes, maybe hours, awake wedged in small, tight spaces, like he’s been doing since he was little. They’re _safe_ . They’re where no one will notice him. Sometimes all he wants is to be noticed by everyone in the world, to be the center of attention, to have every eye in the room. Other times he just wishes he could crawl into a hole and never be seen by another person again. Usually when Mom or Dad are upset about something.

But then, even someone being angry at him is better than him just ghosting through day after day alone in his world. 

The Waynes have shattered his normal. They just tossed it right off the edge of a cliff like it wasn’t worth even glancing at. He’s been yanked into their fold from day one, and it’s been so fast, and so new, that part of him thinks that it’s exactly the kind of thing he should run away from. 

_Most_ of him is craving it more and more every day. He doesn’t know how he’s going to go back to how things were before, when his parents are back from their trip. 

But he’s been fine for years. He’ll be okay again. It’ll be fine. There’s no reason he can’t just go back to his normal, right?

Tim groans and bangs his head on the wall of the closet, over and over, quietly even in the empty house. 

_Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound?_ drifts through his head, from Dick’s musical playlist binge earlier in the day. Tim tip toes through his own home like he’s not allowed to take up space, make noise. At Wayne Manor, he’s all but encouraged to slide down banners singing opera if he feels like it. These two parts of his life that are clashing now, they can’t be more different. And yet Tim, _nighttime_ Tim, BatWatch the bold night reporter, the fearless kid tailing Batman himself, bridges them. Always the same. Always the most honest version of him, in the end. And Tim is so tired of secrets.

He thinks it’s time. He can’t lie to them any longer. Not after all this. After what he’s seen, with them. 

* * *

Tim gets up, disguise tossed in the trash bin. He walks across the grounds all the way back to Wayne Manor. 

Bruce is still in the kitchen, waiting, when Tim slips in from the back. Tim stands for a minute, no words on his tongue to explain, to apologize, to thank him. He stands there, blinking back tears that he _still_ is surprised to find he can cry.

Bruce hands him hot cocoa and pulls him into a hug, and Tim. Tim remembers—

* * *

Jason and Tim in the lounge, playing through the Mass Effect trilogy together over the first week of winter break. Ribbing each other over bad driving, talking about how much they ended up caring about their crew in ME2, how everyone really felt like a crazy tight-knit family on a spaceship with a crazy suicide mission, and how losing someone was so unacceptable they were willing to rewrite hours of playtime to change the outcome. Laughing together, tipped over into each other’s shoulders, laps. Shaking with mirth when Bruce walks in from work with his tie half off just in time to hear Jason cussing out Kai Leng for being a little pointy bitch with poor fashion sense as they take him down on Thessia at last. 

* * *

Dick, kidnapping Tim and taking him out in one of Bruce’s more humble cars to an old stretch of road, saying it was an _older brother duty_ to teach younger ones to drive. Dismissing it when Tim tries to say he doesn’t really count. Patiently spending hours that afternoon teaching Tim the parts of the car, how to adjust mirrors, all the tricks to parallel parking. Letting Tim get a feel for the gas and brake, never once complaining even though Tim jerked them around a million times and probably scared the living daylights out of Dick when he nearly ran off the edge of the road into a ditch after he got startled by a frog. 

Dick wrapping Tim in hug after hug after hug each day, till sometimes Tim has trouble breathing, sometimes starts feeling like he can relax and hug back fully.

* * *

Bruce. Bruce, there, when Tim was sick, there when Tim was cornered and ready to fight the whole world if necessary, holding out a hand and patience and treating Tim like an equal to be respected instead of dismissed. Bruce, who comes running when Tim doesn’t even know he needs someone. Bruce, sharing with Tim the best parts of his traditions, sharing a history, sharing family. Bruce, there to catch him when Tim doesn’t even know what he’s feeling, Bruce, there to carry him when Tim can’t walk, Bruce, Batman, there every night, again and again and again, not even knowing it. 

Bruce, there giving a lifeline to a kid he doesn’t know, shaping years of a life, and will he regret it? Would he still do it again, once he knows?

* * *

Tim takes a deep breath. Pulls out his camera. 

“Bruce,” he whispers. Waits until Bruce pulls back, looking at Tim with that mix of concern, worry, relief. 

“What is it, Tim?” And he’s still so calm, so kind about it. Even after everything Tim has put him through. After how much trouble Tim has been, for absolutely zero reward to Bruce. 

Even now, when Tim is about to hurt Bruce even more.

“I have a secret,” Tim says, and swallows. “I haven’t been honest with you. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Bruce, I should have told you all a long time ago, I should have—well. I…” Tim looks down, shoves his camera at Bruce until he takes it, clutches his mug in both hands. 

“I’m BatWatch,” Tim whispers, and his eyes close. He can’t help but tense up, waiting for the storm that’s about to hit. 

Tim hears a few quiet breaths. There’s a quiet clunk, and then the mug is being pulled from his clenched fingers, one by one. And then two large hands are holding his, and Tim can’t help the shuddering sob that comes out. It’s about to _come_ , he knows, either words in his ears or a hand against his skin. He’s ready. He definitely deserves it, for all this.

“Okay,” Bruce says, softly, and. And.

What?

Tim’s eyes fly open, look up to Bruce’s face, and a part of him shrieks at the boldness, screams _you’re going to pay for daring to look when he’s angry, you know that._  

But Bruce doesn’t look angry. He doesn’t even look disappointed. He just looks _kind_ . 

“Okay?” Tim whispers, asking. 

“It’s okay,” Bruce repeats. “Thank you for telling me the truth. We need to talk about this more, at some point, because it’s definitely not safe. And it absolutely adds a whole new level to the problems with how your parents are raising you, as well as my concerns about your safety. But you’re not in trouble, Tim. I’m not angry at you. You’ve been doing a really dangerous, really impressive thing, and I’m proud of how well you’ve managed for so long. I’m just sorry,” he says, making sure he’s looking Tim right in the eyes, “that you’ve been going through everything so alone all this time.”

He holds Tim for a long while, that night. 

* * *

They have Christmas. Bruce and Tim agree not to bring BatWatch up with anyone else until the new year, so that they have some time to talk and sort out what will happen. Also so that Bruce can have time to figure out a way to tell Dick and Jason that won’t result in an entire day of upset feelings, emotional slingshots, and rushing off to throttle the Drakes and alternately scold and hug Tim until he promises to never put himself in so much danger like that ever again. 

* * *

Dick wakes Tim up in true older sibling fashion on Christmas morning, taking a flying leap from the doorway _straight_ on top of Tim in the bed. Tim wakes up exhausted, and shrieking with laughter in the face of an all-out tickle assault. Together, he and Dick drag a drowsy Jason downstairs to brunch, and everyone eats French Toast and fruit and real maple syrup until they kind of never want to eat anything ever again.

They do presents, and Christmas carols, and a Harry Potter marathon for some reason, and for the first time in his life Tim realizes this is something that he might be able to have someday. This is what a family can be like, not just sometimes, but every day. Maybe his parents can do this too, if he gives them time. Maybe he’ll even end up with a younger sibling he can be a good older brother with, like Dick has been teaching him to be. Maybe he can look out for them the way Jason does for him. 

Tim aches for all the time he hasn’t been given this, all the time in his life he’s spent lonely and lost and _fine_ all on his own, and he aches with the hope that this is what he can make his family become, sometime, maybe. If they all work on it together. Bruce said he’ll do what he can to help, and Tim is ready to try. He’s ready to fight. 

Tim may be exhausted, and the future is uncertain, but right now he’s in a blanket nest with people who really want him around and have been nothing but kind to him since they met. He’s blowing gently on the embers of his hope that things will work out okay, just as Harry is doing the same thing up on Bruce Wayne’s giant TV screen. 

It’s the best Christmas he’s ever had.

#### Notes:

And there it is! Tim's secret is out. At least partly. Well. One of his secrets, anyway. There's a lot of other things he tends to keep to himself, too.

I barely had any time on the computer today, so I didn't catch up on many comment replies, but tomorrow I have a lot of time since I'll be iced in and I'm replying to ALL of you then, love you, please drink plenty of water and eat something if you haven't recently!

Thank you SO MUCH for reading this story, friends.
