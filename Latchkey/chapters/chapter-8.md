# you can still feel small though you are grown

> The aftermath of Tim's misadventure, and also quality Batdad™ featuring Overthinking Tim Drake.

#### Notes:

I have gotten 8.7 hrs of sleep in the past 2 days thanks to work and I'm not the most coherent rn, and I have to go to sleep so I can help wrangle chickens tomorrow, but I've cried six times over how grateful I am for all of you readers, thank you for brightening up my life and walking with me on this fic journey <3

Chapter title is from Walking Away by Regina Spektor.

He blinks awake to the bland interior of a police car. _Probably one of the SUVs,_ Tim assumes, since the backseat he’s sprawled out in is larger and more comfortable than he expected. 

He wiggles around for a moment, taking stock. He feels surprisingly fine, considering the last thing he remembers is passing out in Batman’s arms. The rustling of what has to be at _least_ five separate shock blankets piled on top of him alerts the car’s other occupant that Tim’s awake. Said figure twists around in the front seat, and Tim looks up to lock eyes with Commissioner Gordon himself. 

“Hello, _BatWatch_ ,” Gordon says, and, well. It’s been a good life, all things considered. 

Tim is _so busted._  

* * *

By all rights, Tim should be being grilled by Batman and the police right now, have all his secrets exposed, and also maybe be sitting in a hospital room for overnight observation. Instead, his identity is still secret, Gordon decided to be merciful and whisk him away from the EMS personnel when Batman carried him over (not too hard, since there were so many gas and gunshot victims to deal with), and Tim is thanking _every possible god in every possible universe_ for waterproof makeup and the girl who caught Tim’s attention on youtube a few years back with _if the men find out we can shapeshift, they’re going to tell the Church._

Tim will to have to put together a new look after tonight, but that’s much better than having to deal with the fallout of being completely exposed. He’ll take it. Tonight has been the closest call he’s ever had.

“Contrary to what my behavior tonight would indicate,” Tim informs Gordon as soon as he’s got enough energy back to push himself upright, “I don’t make a habit out of running into danger. I’ve lasted this long because I specifically stay back and use high quality zoom. Believe me, I don’t plan on an encore anytime soon.”

Gordon _hmmms_ at him and takes a large sip of cold coffee. Tim looks at him from under his too-long wig that’s now a disaster of undone man-bun, and wonders _why would you help me_ , and _do you know your only daughter spent years as a vigilante and is still fighting crime as Oracle while away at college, do you know, Gordon,_ and _how do you live with a thousand secrets every day?_

* * *

Once he’s fully awake and sufficiently warmed up, Tim gets a Stern Talking To from Gordon, a dry sweatsuit three sizes too big, and a ride back across the bridge from the police commissioner himself.

“You’re young,” Gordon says, eyes on the road. “I do not want to know how young. I gotta have some plausible deniability, all right? Robin can be a painful exception, because he is effective and he’s got backup and supervision from Batman. You’re flying solo, kid. That’s dangerous.”

“I’ve avoided any trouble or sightings all the way up to now,” Tim says. He’s trying not to bristle too much. “I think I’ve proven I can manage myself fine.”

Gordon looks over for a moment. Sighs. 

“Where am I taking you?” he asks, after a couple minutes of silence.

“Bristol,” Tim says, no hesitation. “Drop me off at the cemetery.”

“Jesus Christ, kid.”

Tim shrugs. “It’s a central location. I can find my way from there.”

“Yeah, without giving me any more clues as to where you’re based. Smart.” Gordon waves a hand in Tim’s direction. “Take the blankets with you, at least, if you’re gonna insist on walking outside for who knows how long.”

Tim thanks him.

As they near their destination, Gordon puts the car in park at a stop sign and stares Tim down. 

Tim tries not to flinch.

“If you pull _anything_ like tonight’s stunt again,” Gordon says, “I am going _straight_ to Batman _and_ social services with everything I do know about you. You’re good at acting mature, and I don’t know where you learned even half of the skills you apparently have, but I’ve dealt with enough precocious teenagers in my career to know that you’re likely no 18-year-old under the disguise. What you’re doing isn’t safe.”

“Nothing in Gotham is,” Tim counters. 

“Maybe so. But at the end of the day, a minor can’t be allowed to run the streets at night, chasing after vigilantes and criminals without any kind of backup. Hell, you shouldn’t be out at night at all. And I’m a mandated reporter by law. I can only lie to myself about plausible deniability for so long, kid.” Gordon sighs and starts the car moving again. “I’m giving you one chance, here. And that’s only because I know you normally _are_ careful, and _will not be doing something like this again._ ”

Tim is not going to win this battle if he chooses to fight it tonight.

“Understood?” Gordon asks.

“Understood,” Tim confirms, and they drive the last few miles in silence. 

“Try and have a safe life, kid,” Commissioner Gordon offers as Tim lets himself out of the passenger door. 

“Thanks,” Tim says, and he means it. “For everything. You’re a good man, Commissioner Gordon. You deserve to hear it from more people than just Batman.” Then Tim turns and runs, slipping behind tall grave markers out of Gordon’s sight. 

* * *

Tim can’t sneak back into Wayne Manor like this, with too-big clothes and no equipment. So he goes home.

Tim showers the harbor stench off after he grabs his duplicate phone with the cloned SIM card in it. He’s never been more grateful to see no new messages before in his life. Tim updates BatWatch with what information and photos he gathered, and pulls in some Twitter updates from GCPD for good measure, to cover up his missing coverage of the Scarecrow incident. 

Tim’s perched on his bed, in warm winter hiking clothes, rubbing his damp hair with a towel, when his phone rings.

And it’s _Bruce_. 

He slides right to accept the call, feeling like a condemned man stepping up to the gallows.

“Hello?” Tim greets. Curse his cracking voice. Puberty can just die in a _fire_ . 

_“Tim,”_ and Bruce’s voice is tight with emotion. Tim can’t quite tell if it’s relief or anger. “Where are you?”

“Uh…” Tim has no idea what he should say at this point. 

Error 404, Tim Drake not found, please try again later. 

“I’m not angry with you,” Bruce adds. “I’m just worried. You weren’t in your room, and no one noticed you leave. What’s going on, Tim? Are you safe? Do you need me to come get you?”

Tim can’t lie to Batman’s face. Ears. Whatever. He just can’t do it. 

“I’m at my house,” Tim says, finally. “I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to freak you out.”

Bruce sighs.

“Sorry,” Tim says again, miserably. 

“It’s all right,” says Bruce. “I’m just glad you’re there and not lost in Gotham, or in a ditch, or out clubbing with college students.”

“No, I’m—I just got out of the shower. I’m in my bed. I’m okay.”

“Good.” There’s a pause for a few beats. “Tim,” Bruce says more softly. “If you’re having trouble adjusting to staying here with us, you can talk to me. We’ll make changes. I want you to be as comfortable and happy as possible. And if there’s something going on in your life, with school or family or a friend, I’m happy to help with that too. I hope we’re not driving you away, I know we’re not the most...traditional personalities. If Dick and Jason are being too pushy I can tell them to give you some space.”

“No, no, it’s been really great,” Tim tries to reassure him. _Shit_. He’s made Batman sad. “You’ve all been wonderful. Seriously.”

“I’ll take your word for it, for now. I’m just glad you’re _safe_ . When I checked in on you for the night, and you weren’t in your bed, or anywhere on the premises, Alfred and I were pretty worried, bud.”

And, oh no. Is Tim about to cry? He’s had a long, exhausting night, he’s worn out from his icy swim, and Batman just said he _checked on Tim_ as if that’s a thing Tim’s ever had anyone do before in his life. And Tim wasn’t even there for it? He _missed it?_

It’s kind of creepy, the concept of someone coming in your room while you’re asleep and just like, looking at you, or checking if you’re still breathing. Whatever people do when they check on kids in the movies. But it’s…

Does Bruce do that for _all_ of them? Has he done it every night Tim’s been staying with them so far, and Tim never knew? Is it a Batman thing, where he just can’t relax enough to stop doing perimeter checks and make sure everyone is still alive, or is this just checking for the sake of checking? And how will Tim manage to sneak out of Wayne Manor at night now if Bruce does rounds when he gets back from patrol? Tim will have to always make it back before Batman if that’s true. 

“Tim?” Bruce asks, and oh, right. They’re still having a conversation.

To his horror, Tim sniffles. Like a little kid. 

And of course Bruce hears it. Because _Batman_.

“Tim, buddy, are you okay?” Bruce sounds stressed. “Hang on, I can come over, I’ll grab my coat right now.” There’s a loud thud in the background.

“It’s okay,” Tim says, wetly. “You don’t need to, don’t worry, I’m sorry—”

“I’m coming,” Bruce says firmly, and, well. Tim supposes that’s probably that, but he’s got to _try_.

“Seriously, I’m fine,” Tim protests. “I’ve just had a—it’s been a weird night, it’s fine, I’ll come back. You don’t need to worry about me. I can handle myself.”

“You don’t need to, though. It’s my _job_ to worry about you. You’re still a kid, Tim, it’s okay to need some help every now and then. Even adults do. I’ll be there in six minutes.” The line goes dead. 

Six minutes. With how large their properties are, the only way Bruce is getting to Drake Manor in six minutes is if he runs. Which means Batman, after a full night of crime fighting and a visit to Arkham, is running across manicured winter lawn full of frost, in the dark, at _stupid_ o’clock in the morning, in probably pajamas and an overcoat, for _Tim_. 

Batman is coming over because Tim can’t tell the _truth_ and made Bruce Wayne think he needs a grown up shoulder to cry on, and god, what is Tim’s _life_.

* * *

Tim is prepared, he’s pretty sure, after throwing all incriminating evidence into a spare room’s closet, and getting himself wrapped up in his old comforter. He’s got a sufficiently sympathetic story lined up about what might have made him feel the urge to run away back to his own empty home late at night, even though he’s never indicated he’s particularly fond of the place during any other time. He’s done breathing exercises to get rid of the sniffling issue. He’s ready.

Bruce knocks, and Tim is opening the oppressive front doors, in this giant empty husk of a house that feels more like a tomb just waiting for Tim to fall far enough down the rabbit hole one day, and Tim opens his mouth to start, but.

“Tim,” Bruce says, opening his arms. “Hey. Whatever’s wrong, bud, it’s going to be okay. I’ve got you.” 

And it’s just the _very_ last straw. In a long, long line of straws. Does Bruce just have those two phrases on a broken record in his brain or something? Is it just a reaction to Tim specifically? How many times is Tim going to have Batman say the same thing to him in one month? 

Tim is out of his body and hovering like a balloon from a tenuous string, paused in existence, maybe not even breathing. And there’s Bruce, patient and waiting, not pushing. Just handing Tim the offer if he wants to accept it. And Tim, frozen in front of him, one hand on the door he’s just shut in the awful echoing emptiness, one hand clutching the comforter around his neck like he’s a little kid playing superheroes again. Always alone. Always doing it himself.

Nothing actually _happened_ tonight, Tim isn’t actually having a problem, but Bruce has come anyway. Bruce has showed up. Which very, very few people in Tim’s life have ever done for him. And Bruce has to be _tired_ , and sore, and want nothing more than to go sleep for a week, but he still looked for Tim, and worried, and ran a mile in the cold because he thought Tim needed a hug. And Tim could have _died_ tonight, honest to god. It’s finally beginning to set in.

And Tim is suddenly slamming back into his body, time no longer frozen in crystal. He looks at Bruce, between his warm, tired eyes and his open arms, sees the small nod of encouragement, and. 

And and _and_. 

Tim takes in one shuddering breath, launches himself across the cold tile at Bruce hard enough to bowl a smaller man over. But this is Batman, this is Bruce, and he just catches Tim and hauls him up into his arms like he weighs nothing, even though Tim knows he’s heavier than he looks. Tim wraps his legs around Bruce’s waist, shoves his face into a shoulder. 

“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Bruce murmurs in his ear. “You can let go. I’ll hold on for you, for a while. You can take a break.” 

Tim doesn’t cry, but it’s a near thing. He lets out an occasional choked gasp, shakes like a leaf against Bruce’s chest until they both end up asleep in one of the numerous giant armchairs. 

In the morning, Tim wakes up in his bed upstairs. Bruce is asleep on the floor below, leaned against the hard bed frame. He still has Tim’s hand wrapped securely in his. Tim thinks that maybe, possibly, this is the kind of parent he’s been missing all these years. He knows Bruce isn’t _his_, not really, but...maybe this isn’t just something that happens in stories after all. Maybe it _does_ exist behind closed doors and lit windows. And maybe it could be okay...maybe it can be okay for Tim to try it out while he’s got it, after all. Just for a while. 

Maybe Tim can take a break, just this once, since Bruce really wants to be an adult for him for some reason. It’s been so long since Tim didn’t have to raise himself, he’s not sure he remembers what he’s supposed to _do_. But until his parents come back...he thinks he’s willing to try.
