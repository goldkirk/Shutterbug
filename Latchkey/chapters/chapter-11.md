I really, really hope this chapter doesn't come off as rushed, but I am so tired of writing/tweaking lmao here enjoy!!! 

 **CONTENT WARNING:** past child abuse discussion, dissociative episode

Chapter title is from "Runaway" by Aurora.

* * *

Tim doesn’t go back to his house that evening, and his parents don’t call. 

He sends them a text saying he’s safe anyway.

* * *

Bruce almost calls child services right then and there. Jason, once he’s home from track practice that night, is on board with that plan. But Tim doesn’t want it to escalate to that, not yet, and when they realize how genuinely distressed Tim is getting over the idea Bruce agrees to wait for now. 

“Despite the fact that in actuality there have been many, many strikes,” he says, “we’ll call today officially strike two.” 

“Strike three and you’re out?” Tim quips with a weak smile. 

“Strike three and I call my resource family support worker from CPP and inform her that we need to add someone to the official house occupancy list. And my lawyers, to start working on emergency custody paperwork.”

Tim stares. 

“Shut your mouth, you’ll catch flies,” Jason says, gently tapping Tim’s nose with a finger. 

Tim’s face scrunches. He will not cry. He _will not cry,_ he’s already sobbed on Bruce once today. Tim is not a kid, he can get a grip. 

“You’d—?” he starts, and cant finish the sentence.

Bruce pulls out a chair and sits in front of Tim. Alfred comes over as well, putting a hand on Bruce’s shoulder and sending Tim a soft smile. 

“I told you, we’re going to make things okay.” Bruce clasps his hands, rests his elbows on his knees as he leans closer to Tim. “And I mean that, whatever it takes. You deserve to have a safe, stable home where someone is there to look out for you and have your back. If you want me to, and if it comes down to it, I’d be honored to have you come live here with us permanently.” 

Tim is wrong. He _will_ cry again. 

“You—but—“ and he’s already choking up again, here he goes. “You’ve only known me for a few months,” Tim tries to protest. “And I can’t do anything for you. You’ve already done so much and I can’t pay you back for anything, and I just keep bringing you problems. And you already have a family.” 

Jason yanks Tim into a hug and somewhat aggressively shoves his own beanie onto Tim’s head before putting hands on both sides of his face and squishing Tim’s cheeks like a chipmunk. 

“Timbo,” Jason says. “I love you, but you are really, really dumb sometimes. You don’t have to _do_ anything for Bruce. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but he really likes taking people in like stray puppies, and if he liked me and brought me home after I hit him with a tire iron in the middle of the night, I’m pretty sure you don’t have anything to worry about here.” 

“Y’r’ squish’n me,” Tim says. Jason clunks their foreheads together once before letting go. 

“Master Tim,” says Alfred, finally breaking his silence. He’s kept Tim supplied with a steady stream of tea like it’s the lifeline keeping Tim afloat right now (and maybe it is, Tim wouldn’t be surprised), but has so far seemed content to let the others do the speaking. 

Tim looks up at Alfred, questioning. 

“Love,” says Alfred, “is not conditional. It is often effortful, sometimes painful. But it is not selfish, or bargaining like a business deal. It is not a formula of owing. Approval or tolerance are not the same as love. Do you understand? You do _not_ need to earn—or even reciprocate, should you not wish to—any of our love for you, Master Tim. It is freely and willingly given, and not dependent on anything you can do for us.”

Tim is...so confused. He’s. He’s sure Alfred is _right_, because Alfred is always right. And his words match what Tim has observed of the Wayne household. But no, Tim just doesn’t _understand_ . 

He loves his parents. His parents love him. They give him what he needs, pay for his hobbies, talk with him about their work when he’s curious and even help him with homework sometimes. On good days, they have nice conversations and let Tim complain to them about his kid problems. 

His mom taught him how to bake the best challah bread in the world, spending hours and hours helping him measure ingredients and learn to braid the dough. And just the other day his dad spent the morning working on Tim’s project with him. Tim behaves and makes them proud, and they tell him he’s done well and spend time with him when they’re home. 

There is always the unspoken understanding that if Tim is bad, they’ll be upset with him and there would be consequences. And it’s _fine_, because how the world works, at home and at school and in society at large. Do something bad, face the music. Do something good, and you’re accepted. Right? There are _rules_ for these things. 

“Tim,” and it’s Bruce talking again. Carefully. Gently. “Do you love Jason?”

“Of course,” Tim answers promptly. 

“Why?”

Tim stares for a moment. “What do you mean _why?”_ 

“Why do you love Jason?” 

“He’s nice,” Tim says, and no, that’s too simple. “He’s _good_ . He’s kind to everyone unless they’re being a terrible person. He’s funny. He wants to hang out with me, and he makes my days better. I like spending time with him.” 

“Why do you like spending time with him?” 

Tim is getting frustrated. “Because I do?”

“Why, Tim?” Bruce insists, calmly. 

“Because he’s my friend! He’s enjoyable and fun and kind and good, and he’s always nice to me and nice to _be_ with.” 

“So is a Starbucks barista,” Jason says, grinning a little. “Try harder. Something makes it different, when it’s _me_ instead of anyone else.” 

“Why is he nice to be with, Tim?” Bruce prompts. 

_“I don’t know what you want me to say!”_ Tim snaps at the two of them, and then he’s bursting into tears. _God_ . God, he knew he shouldn’t have come. He’s just hurting Bruce again. He’s acting just like his dad. And he’d yelled at his _dad_ , earlier, too. No wonder his own father didn’t like him half the time. He can’t even control his own reactions. 

This time, it’s Alfred guiding Tim up from his chair and out into the hallway, into a spare room. He puts his hands on Tim’s shoulders. 

“Timothy,” Alfred says, softly. “Timothy, lad, look at me.”

Tim scrubs fiercely at his eyes with his knuckles, angry at himself for crying again, for shouting, angry at everyone and angry that he doesn’t understand _why_ . The loss of control is miserable and he can’t seem to turn it _off_ today. He doesn’t want to feel this. Tim doesn’t _do_ breakdowns. What is wrong with him?

Alfred catches his fists and pulls them away from his face. 

“What Master Bruce was trying to guide you to realize,” he says to Tim, “is that you love Master Jason because he is _Jason_. Not for his jokes, or his ongoing efforts to ensure you eat more than once a day, or his generosity and care for others. Those things are all a part of it, because they are a part of him. But you like being friends with Master Jason because he is _himself_ . Any one person can have all those same traits you listed before. But no one else is _Jason Peter Todd,_ and that makes him precious to you _.”_  

Tim sniffs. “You mean, I like him just for being him, not what he does for me or brings to my life?”

“Exactly.” Alfred smiles. 

And Tim gets it. He does! But it’s not the same. Jason is…

Jason is _Robin_, and he was chosen by Bruce, and he’s got skills and value and a warm personality, and Jason’s...well, he’s _him_. But Tim is different. Tim’s no one’s choice. 

He’s _fine_, of course, and he tries to be as good a person as he can. But he’s not like Jason. People like Tim as long as he does good things. The street kids like him because he brings food and doesn’t think they’re lesser than he is, and his teachers like him because he does quality work and contributes to class discussions. His parents like him when he’s good, because then he’s being a well-behaved son they can be proud of. 

The Waynes like him because—he doesn’t really know. They’re saying it’s because they just do? Because he’s him? But that’s not how it _works_. It’s such a nice thought, and Tim has loved the attention they’ve given him in the past few months, but it’s just not correct. 

Tim hates to break it to them, but he’s not as great as they seem to think he is. He knows it’s only a matter of time until they see it, too. He tries his best to always be good, but somehow always slips up. And they’ll see that. They’ve started to already, while he’s been giving Bruce the cold shoulder lately and snapping at them in the kitchen just now. 

They can only put up with Tim so many times before they get fed up with him. 

The door opens. Bruce steps in and gently pushes Tim over to the edge of the bed to sit, then kneels down in front of him. Jason sits on the floor nearby, criss-cross applesauce. 

“Tim,” Bruce says, like he’s speaking to a wounded animal. “I want you to tell me what’s going on in your head right now. It doesn’t matter if you think it’s stupid, okay? I want to know what’s going on in that beautiful big brain of yours. I mean that.” 

Tim shakes his head. Bruce’s eyebrows furrow, ever so slightly. 

“Tim, I really want to help. But I can’t if I don’t know what’s going on. Come on, buddy. What are you thinking about right now?” 

“You’re going to get tired of me,” Tim blurts out. Bruce looks surprised (not as surprised as Tim feels!), but before he can say anything, Tim is talking again. It feels horrifyingly as if Tim just uncorked a shaken bottle of champagne, and everything is trying to pour out. 

“You’re going to realize that I’m not worth it. You’ll just leave. You don’t want to _now_, but you haven’t been around long enough. I know how it works. I’m not good enough to—to make it worth people’s while. It always starts good and then falls apart.” Tim takes a shuddering breath and looks at the dresser. “You should walk away from my life while you still have the chance. I’m just going to keep letting you down all the time.” 

Shit. He’s said way too much. This is why Tim _doesn’t talk about feelings_. 

“They don’t like me,” he says, then, and _oh my god_, can’t he shut up?

“Who doesn’t?” Jason asks. Because Bruce is looking too stunned to say anything at the moment. Tim thinks he’s rebooting. 

“My parents,” Tim says. “They love me. But I don’t think they _like_ me all that much.”

Bruce has powered back on now, and Tim can literally see Batman Mode trying to come online in his face. 

“What,” Bruce says, clipped and careful, “makes you feel like that’s the case, Tim?” 

Tim opens his mouth. Closes it. He shakes his head. How do you tell someone _everything_ but also _I know they love me, they’re good people and tell me they do and I have lots of happy memories of them._ How does he tell Bruce _I feel like they don’t know me and they don’t want to listen when I’m talking about things_ when his dad got involved in his school project the other day?

How can Tim say _they always leave me and it hurts_ when he knows that it’s their job and he’s well provided for anyway? 

“Too big, Bruce,” Jason says, in a certain tone of voice. Like it’s a code between them or something. And maybe it is, because something seems to light in Bruce’s eyes. 

“Let’s start simpler,” he tells Tim. “Can I ask you some questions? You can say as much or as little as you want. Jason and Dick call it the boulder method.” He smiles. “It gets easier once you talk about smaller things first.”

It can’t hurt. Tim nods. 

“We’ll start out easy. Yes or no questions, all right? Just shake or nod your head if you don’t want to talk.” Bruce glances at Alfred, who slips out of the room, then back to Tim. 

Jason hops up on the bed and puts an arm around Tim in solidarity, starts kicking his feet back and forth like a kid. 

“Did your father hit you today, Tim?”

Tim shakes his head vehemently. No! Of course not. Does Bruce think his parents are _abusive?_ Is _that_ what this is about?

“Okay. That’s good. Did your mother?” 

No.

“Have either of them ever hit you?” 

Tim’s face twists. Not _hit_ the way Bruce is thinking. He hasn’t been abused. It’s not like _that_. They’ve just slapped him a few times over the years, and spanked him when he was a kid. But it’s Batman, and Tim knows people don’t get away with half truths, so he nods and makes an _eh, sorta_ motion with his hand that isn’t trapped next to his body by Jason. 

“Can you use words to tell me what that means?” And what is he, a kindergartener? _Yes_, Mr. Wayne, he does know how to use his words! What the hell.

“They never hit me badly,” Tim mutters. He wants to stop with the questions. “Just a slap or two, you know. And really rarely. Only when I definitely deserved it.” 

Jason’s hand tightens on his arm for a moment. Bruce’s expression doesn’t change, and Tim is grateful for it. He has so, so completely lost control of this situation. This whole day, really. 

Bruce nods once. “Okay. Do your parents yell at you, when they’re home?”

A nod. 

“Are there any times when you’re afraid of them?” 

Tim swallows. Nods again. 

“But—“ he starts, and Bruce puts a hand on his knee. 

“It’s yes or no. Do you want to change your answer to a no?” 

Tim hesitates. 

“No, but—“ 

“We’re going slow, remember?” Brice asks. He looks at Tim carefully.  “Why do you feel like you need to qualify this answer right now?

“I…” Tim frowns. “They’re...they’re good people. It’s not their fault.”

Bruce nods. “You think that your parents making you afraid is something people might see as wrong?”

“I’m not a kid!” Tim snaps at him, and then immediately feels terrible. He shudders in a breath, and Jason puts his head on Tim’s shoulder. 

“I’m sorry,” Bruce tells him after a moment. He reaches out and takes Tim’s hands in his.  “You’re right. You’ve proven multiple times that you’re intelligent and mature. I’m going to level with you, Tim.” 

Tim straightens slightly.

“You’ve been neglected by your parents, in supervision and attention. And I also think you’ve been emotionally abused by them.” 

No. Nope! They’re not doing this. This is not what Tim wanted to happen. His parents aren’t like that! They’re not evil people! They’re not trying to hurt Tim, they love him. They’re doing the best they can to parent him. And Tim isn’t always kind to them either, he yells and fights right back. 

Bruce doesn’t know what he’s talking about, which is what Tim was _trying_ to tell him earlier. 

“There are a lot of signs that children who grow up in certain kinds of situations have, and despite how impressively well-adjusted you’ve trained yourself to be, Alfred and I have noticed some of them in you since we met.” 

Tim shakes his head furiously, but Bruce isn’t done. 

“I know them because Jason had them too. Still _has_ some of them. And we were able to help him because we noticed.” Bruce’s thumb runs gently over the back of Tim’s free hand. “I don’t think anyone’s really tried to help you in a long time.” 

Tim’s eyes are shut now. He’s breathing fast. Needs to get out and hide. There are some good hiding places in the manor. He knows them. He can make it. 

“Can you tell me a couple of the things that they did that made you feel unsafe?” Bruce asks, and Tim, for whatever reason, _still can’t stop talking._  

“We were fighting. A couple years ago. She—my mom, and me, we were yelling, and she was mad and I was mad, and I couldn’t calm down, and I went to far, and she said she was going to leave and she did. She walked out the door. I heard her car leave.” Tim is nearly gasping for air, and Jason is rubbing firm circles on his back, making soft noises that probably would be sort of soothing if Tim had more than half a brain cell left to appreciate them. “I was afraid she wasn’t coming back.” 

“Dude,” Jason says quietly. “That’s kind of really fucked up. That’s not right.”

“Today,” Tim chokes out. When did air get so hard to breathe? His hands are shaking between Bruce’s steady fingers. “When Dad was yelling, he yanked out my TV and threw it in the hallway, and he stepped on my camera lens to punish me. But he was still mad. I don’t know why he was so mad, I didn’t mean to be bad, I shouldn’t have given him attitude! I know better!” 

“Timmers, breathe slow,” Jason says. His voice is getting distant.

“He locked me out,” Tim gasps. “I said I was sorry. I said I was _sorry_.”

This is too much. Tim doesn’t know why he’s saying all this. Bruce asked, yeah, but Tim knows better. He hasn’t been _abused_ . It’s not nearly that bad, you know? His parents are good people. They’re not trying to hurt their own kid. They get stressed, and Tim isn’t always well-behaved, and he has to have consequences when he doesn’t behave properly. It’s _normal_ . But now Bruce thinks he’s been abused, and so does Jason, Tim guesses, and everything is getting really, really distant now, like he’s taken two steps backwards and is just watching from outside himself. All he can feel is numb, faint curiosity. The fear and anger stayed with his body.

He’s not controlling what his body does right now, and that’s kind of scary, Tim doesn’t like that. But he’s also not feeling overwhelmed anymore. That’s not so bad. 

Alfred opens the door and comes in with a mug of what’s probably more of the good tea. Tim zooms his hearing in, catches Jason talking.

“Good job Tim, you’re doing great! Nice and slow, just like that.”

Tim’s body is settled down now. Huh. 

But Bruce is frowning. He’s looking intently at Tim’s face, brushing some of Tim’s dark hair back behind his ear gently. 

“Tim, sweetheart?” Bruce asks. “Are you with us right now?”

“Yes,” Tim says, and it’s flat. 

_“Tim,”_ Bruce says, more insistently.

“B?” asks Jason. “Is—”

“Tim, talk to me buddy,” Bruce says firmly. He’s got his fingers on Tim’s wrist, pressing into his pulse point. Tim thinks it’s kind of silly. His body only manages a vague hum. 

“Oh,” Jason says, and he sounds sad. Tim feels sorry. He doesn’t ever want to hurt Jason. He didn’t mean to make him sad, with whatever is happening right now. But this is so much better than feeling everything like before. “Tim checked out?”

“I think so,” Bruce responds, most of his attention on Tim’s face while he rubs his hands up and down Tim’s shoulders. “We pushed him too fast. It’s a lot to have to realize, if he’s been blocking out the truth to cope.”

Tim wants Bruce to keep doing that. He feels warmer. He can maybe feel some pressure on his arms.

Alfred puts the mug on the nightstand, then leans out the door and whistles down the hallway. “Ace! Come, boy.” The German shepherd pads into the room moments later, and Bruce gestures at Tim’s body. 

“Ace,” he commands, ” _druk_.”

Ace hops up on the bed, as Bruce gently levers Tim down flat. Jason scoots away far enough to give Ace room, but puts a hand on Tim’s ankle. Ace drapes his weight across Tim’s body from left hip to right shoulder, careful and firm. 

At some point, Tim starts feeling a bit more real. He’s warmer, and heavy. Like something is pulling him down. Pushing him back. As several minutes pass, Tim slowly slips closer and closer to himself, until finally he can feel not just the pressure and warmth, but Ace’s fur rubbing his skin, his soft _whuff_ing close to Tim’s ear. 

Tim blinks, breathes in, and he’s back. 

“Bruce,” he says, automatically, and _there_, Bruce is there. Bruce is _still there_.

“Hey, buddy,” Bruce says, painful softness in his smile. “Glad you’re back with us.”

“Where’d I go,” Tim mumbles. 

“You dissociated for a bit, pretty hardcore.” Jason’s tone is nothing but factual. He stretches out on the bed next to Tim, meets his eyes calmly. “Has that happened before?”

“Uh,” Tim says, intelligently. It feels like he’s lagging, like when he tried to play Skyrim on the six year old laptop at Ives’ old house. “Only for a second.”

“Okay. Well, it sucks. It doesn’t happen to me anymore, but I remember. I’m sorry.”

“S’okay,” Tim says, and _wow_, he’s tired. Not sleepy tired. Just...existence tired. His brain doesn’t want to _work_. He’s like...mushy grapes. Yeah. Still edible, but like, sad and squishy. Wait. Tim doesn’t want his brain to be edible. No zombies.

“Tim,” Bruce says gently. “I want you to stay here for at least the night, okay? I know you love your parents. And I believe you, that they aren’t meaning to hurt you or be bad. All right? No one is saying your parents are evil.”

“Okay,” Tim says.

“But people can love you and not intend to do anything wrong, and still hurt you. That doesn’t make them bad people. But it is still doing a lot of damage, regardless of intent. That’s what I think is happening to you.”

“Okay.”

“I’m going to talk with my lawyers and your parents, about doing kinship care,” Bruce says. He’s going slow. Tim appreciates it, since his brain is definitely _not_ all there right now. “We can settle that out of court, if your parents cooperate, and if I’m listed as a family friend you’re comfortable living with, you can stay with me as your legal caretaker indefinitely. Like Dick did. Long-term foster care. Or, if you want it, we could see if your parents would do a full adoption process out of court. But you don’t need to worry about that right now, Tim. Do you trust me?”

“Of _course_,” Tim says. He’s a little offended Bruce even asked.

“Then trust me when I say that all you need to worry about is settling in here and feeling whatever you need to feel. I’ve got the legal matters covered, okay? And if your parents decide they want to take it to family court, I’m going to fight for you every step of the way. No worrying about logistics.”

“Mkay,” Tim says. Jason’s fingers are drawing heavenly circles through Tim’s hair, and Ace is squashing Tim like the world’s best blanket, and Alfred’s tea is smells sweet and warm nearby, and he’s got nothing left. He’s wrung out like a ratty old dish rag. 

Tim closes his eyes as Bruce presses a kiss to his forehead. 

“You’re not alone, Tim,” Bruce says softly. “I’m not going to let anyone hurt you while you’re part of this family. I’ve got you.”

“I know,” Tim mumbles. “Y’r Batman.” As if that settles everything. And then he’s out like a light, completely missing the shock that hits everyone like a bolt of lighting. 

* * *

Bruce blinks down at Tim. Stares at Jason for a moment. Looks back down to Tim. “Did he just say _Batman?”_  

“He did, Master Bruce,” Alfred says calmly. A little _too_ calmly. 

“He knew? And Alfred...” 

Jason shrugs at Bruce.

Bruce turns to frown at Alfred. “You _knew?_ How long have you known he knew?”

“Master _Bruce_. I might remind you that while Thomas and Martha were your parents, I am the one who raised you through the majority of your formative years, and much of your early reconnaissance training. It is my entire job to know everything that goes on in this manor.”

“But…”

Jason laughs at Bruce. “He’s Alfie,” he says, as if that explains everything.

Alfred finally takes pity on Bruce. “Master Timothy never spoke with me about any of it,” he explains. “But I knew about his sneaking out, and I have been an avid follower of BatWatch for years. Many of his speech patterns carry over. It was not difficult to put one and one together and make two.”

“Only you, Alfred,” says Bruce, running a hand down his face. “Only you.”

* * *

Tim wakes up the next morning to golden sunlight and fingers carding gently through his hair. He opens his eyes to see Dick near the edge of the bed, his head propped on one arm. Dick smiles, genuine and wide and unconditional. 

“Dick?” Tim croaks. He hopes Alfred has more of that tea today, because Tim is definitely feeling the punishment of a crying dehydration headache.

“Hey, Timbit,” Dick whispers. He smooths Tim’s hair back again, fingers so gentle on Tim’s forehead. Slowly rubs out the gathering wrinkles there. “Heard you had a bad day, huh?”

Tim hates how quickly his eyes well up. 

“Oh, baby,” Dick says, and then he’s scooting Tim over and clambering under the blanket with him like they’re kids or something. He wraps Tim up in a hug and shushes him gently while he cries for what feels like the millionth time in recent history. 

Jason cracks the door open, then pads softly across the carpet and climbs up to sandwich Tim in on his other side. He starts reading _Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_ off his phone while Tim settles back down. 

“I love you so much, Tim, you know that right?” Jason asks after a while. 

“That’s sappy.” Tim pokes Jason in the ribs from the safety of his cocoon in Dick’s arms. 

“I’ll be as sappy as I want, I don’t give a shit,” Jason fires back. He pokes Tim between the eyes, then rolls over onto his back again. “I love you. Damn.”

“Me too, Tim,” Dick murmurs, half asleep. 

“I,” Tim starts. Clears his throat. “I love you guys too. You’re the best.”

Tim lies there, between the two brothers, in the morning sunlight, and thinks, _if things had to go wrong, at least they’re going partly right too._  

The situation? It _sucks_. Royally. But right now, this? This...is pretty nice. Tim is going to let himself enjoy it for a moment, while it lasts.
