#### Notes:

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR READING ALONG AS I WROTE THIS WILD THING. I had no idea what I was doing when I started it, and basically spent the past few weeks churning out chapters in a fever dream of sleep deprivation, and you have all be SO KIND AND ENCOURAGING, and I want to thank you for all the wonderful comments and messages. You 500% kept me so motivated to keep going with this. 

Chapter title is from "Unbreakable" by Birds of Tokyo.

Credit for the BatWatch idea goes to ZervaWyte who I love very dearly as always

There are good days and there are bad days. 

And slowly, slowly, Tim’s building a space in this new family of his own.

* * *

Tim wakes up to a bang and a crash, and also what sounds suspiciously like a basketball being dribbled, and he drags himself over to crack the bedroom door open just as Jason does the same across the hallway. 

They stare at each other, then over towards the stairs. And then suddenly the dribbling gets louder, a stereo blasts out, and _Dick_ is dancing down the hallway singing at the top of his lungs.

“WHAT TIME IS IT? _SUMMER TIME!_ IT’S OUR VACATION! WHAT TIME IS IT?”

_“Too fuckin early,”_ Jason moans, completely in tune, as he slumps against the doorframe, eyes drooping shut. Tim laughs under his breath.

“Richard,” Bruce says from further down the hallway, voice raised slightly to be heard over the loud music. 

“Good _morning,_ father dearest,” Dick says, beaming. Tim feels like he ought to squint against the radiance.

“It is five thirty in the morning, Dick,” Bruce points out with remarkable patience.

“It’s _summer_,” Dick says, and then he’s singing along again. 

Tim frowns. “You don’t even go to school, though…?” 

Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose, visibly counting to ten. He’d only gotten back from patrol a few hours earlier, long after Jason and Tim had passed out on the couch surrounded by popcorn kernels, melted ice cream, and several DVD cases, in celebration of the school year’s end. He roused them just enough to herd them up to bed, then fell gratefully onto his own enormous mattress—blessedly free of any interlopers, he checked—and passed right out.

Dick turns around and chucks the basketball to Bruce without warning, then cartwheels over to Jason, catching his brother’s face between his hands. 

“Go get dressed, buddy,” he orders. “We’re going on an adventure.”

“Dick,” Jason moans. He’s trying for a pitiable pout. Tim thinks he looks more like a disgruntled cockapoo, but. A+ for effort? It’s early, after all. Tim probably looks like a newly minted member of the Adams family, himself.

“Clothes. Then head for the Thunderbird, we’re riding in style,” Dick says firmly. He crosses the hallway and yanks Tim into a hug. “You too, baby bird.”

“What we gotta dress for, then?” Jason grumbles, scrubbing at his eyes. Tim can see him yanking drawers open with more force than usual. 

“Grammar, Jason,” Bruce chides. 

Jason sighs _loudly,_ head tipped back and eyes on the ceiling, for _six entire seconds._  

“What do we need to be dressed for,” Jason grits out at last.

“Active clothes. Casual.” Dick turns to look at Bruce. “You too, big man.”

Bruce shakes his head, but disappears back into his room anyway. They can all hear the closet door hinges creak open. 

_“And_ you, baby bird,” Dick says, stepping over to give Tim a noogie. _“Get.”_ Tim could technically have ducked away, but. It’s kinda nice to be noogied by an experienced big brother, sometimes. 

So Tim goes. Gets dressed. Attempts for all of ten whole seconds to tame his increasingly-wild hair—_is there something in this house that just makes every occupant’s hair go crazy?_ Tim wonders. _Does vigilante-cowl-crazy just…permeate the very air we breathe?_

Or maybe Tim just forgot what it was like when his hair is grown out past a close trim. He’s kind of wondering how long it will take Bruce to get annoyed at him for having his hair too long, since it’s been three months and the man still hasn’t said a word.

He’ll find out, sooner or later. This kind of hair isn’t proper for a young man in high society. Tim knows that. It’s only a matter of time. 

* * *

“Dude,” Jason says, when they’re lying on Jason’s bed one afternoon in some sunbeams, lazily ricocheting a bouncy ball off of the room’s corners as “training” or whatever. “Dick had a _mullet_ once. The most B did was sigh a few times, and make one single comment about ‘parties in the back’ being an interesting vintage choice, and that was _it_ . I don’t think he cares, as long as we’re happy with how our hair looks and keep it clean.”

“Hm,” Tim says, noncommittally. 

So it becomes sort of an experiment. 

* * *

Bruce never says a word, but once Tim’s fast-growing hair is tickling the bottoms of his ears, Bruce hands him some scrunchies and offers to teach Tim how to French braid some pigtails or a waterfall. 

Tim says yes. 

Bruce kindly doesn’t comment when Tim starts to cry in the middle of their tutorial time, just stops to clipTim’s hair in place for the moment and haul him up into Bruce’s lap for a long hug. 

“You don’t have to,” Tim sniffs at bruce, his cheeks still soaked. “You know that, right? I’ve been doing it myself for like. Forever. I don’t really care about my hair. I just…”

“You’re pushing boundaries to see when I’ll snap,” Bruce says, kindly. Tim flushes, and hates the burning-ears feeling with a passion. Bruce’s fingers dig into the sides of Tim’s lower neck, trying to work away some of the tension building there. “I know. You’re not my first rodeo. It’s not a problem, buddy. As long as you don’t endanger yourself by trying to take the Maserati for a joyride or harass your brothers too much, you just keep doing what you need to for now. I won’t be mad. Especially not over something as much of a non-issue as _hair,_ in the grand scheme of things.”

_Well. He is Batman,_ Tim supposes. Of course Bruce saw right through him.

“You’re allowed to, though, you know.”

“What?” Tim croaks.

“Care about your hair.” Bruce clarifies, smiling at him. “It’s _your_ body. Your hair. You should always feel comfortable in your own skin, and wear your hair however makes you happy. It’s okay to let yourself want it to look a certain way, even if it’s not what someone else prefers.”

They’re quiet for a few moments as Tim thinks about that.  
“Mom never liked my hair to be longer than a couple of inches,” Tim says quietly. “I just...didn’t really let myself think about it that much, except to go ‘oh, oops, it’s getting long, better go get a trim.’ Because it didn’t _matter_. I already had a haircut and that was that.”

“Well,” says Bruce. “Are there any hairstyles you _like?”_

“I haven’t really looked.” Tim pushes himself off of Bruce. Smiles tentatively. “I guess I could start window shopping?”

“Sure. Find some pictures, try out some looks. Dye your hair blue for all I care, bud. You’re thirteen, you’ve got plenty of time to experiment. This phase of your life is all about reinventing and finding yourself anyway—you’re going to build yourself into your best self and I can’t wait to see it.” Bruce frowns. “Did I just _parent_ you? Did that last sentence really come out of my mouth?” 

“Yeah, I think you did,” Tim laughs. “B, I hate to break it to you, but you are, in fact, a parent. And, uh, if we’re being honest right now, I think you’re doing a pretty great job of it. You know. For what it’s worth, coming from someone who wouldn’t know much about parenting if it bit him in the ankle.”

Bruce kisses Tim’s forehead. 

“Love you, Tim,” he says warmly.

“Love you to, B.” Tim says. “Thanks. For…” He doesn’t finish the sentence. Doesn’t quite know what he means to say there. Everything? Doing his hair? Being the parent Tim hasn’t ever had? Caring? Holding Tim and never acting mad, even when he must be feeling it? Being Batman? Dealing with all of Tim’s messes?

It’s okay. Batman gets what he means anyway. He’s good like that.

* * *

Tim settles on growing his hair out _just_ long enough for a small bun with wispy sides. And it turns out his hair has been curly all these years, not just unruly. He never _knew_ .

“Well,” Tim says, staring contemplatively at the wafer cookie in his hand. “That explains why it’s always been a nightmare to try to make it lie flat. It hasn’t been straight a day in its life.”

“Like me,” Jason says casually around a mouthful of lemon ice. 

Tim nearly chokes.

“Come on,” Jason says, thumping Tim on the back, as if he didn’t just throw out a pretty significant piece of information seconds before. “Let’s go to my bathroom. I’m going to teach you how to use hair gel to work _with_ your hair instead of plastering it down, crying and screaming and as crunchy as a boy band from the mid-90s.”

* * *

Summer means no school. And no school means _Babs is home_ . Oracle has signed off, and Batgirl is back in business. 

Tim comes back early from his nightly surveillance routes so he can surprise Batgirl on her first night back on regular patrol in months. The family has, so far, _not_ told her about the new addition to the Wayne family, and Barbara generally leaves Bruce’s personal files alone. So Tim is still a complete unknown. He’s perched on a stool next to where Alfred mans the Batcomputer in Bruce’s enormous rolling chair. 

“So,” Nightwing begins as he and Batgirl hop off of the motorcycle they just rode in through the Batcave’s entrance. “Bruce may have _possibly_ taken another little stray bird into the nest.”

“Really.” Batgirl sounds amused. 

“Mm hm. He’s a good one,” Nightwing says fondly. “You’ve actually run into him before, you know.”

“Have I?”

“Yeah. You know him by a different name though.”

“Hi Dick!” Tim chooses this moment to cheerfully hop off the stool and walk into their line of sight. 

“Baby bird!” Dick sweeps Tim up into an enormous spinning hug, so tight that Tim feels his back crack. He can’t help the near-giggles that are slipping out of him until he’s finally set down again. Nightwing keeps an arm slung around Tim’s shoulders.

“Batgirl, meet Tim,” he says proudly. “Tim, Batgirl.”

“It’s an honor to meet you, Miss Gordon,” Tim says politely, as they shake hands.

Batgirl jerks back as if she’s been burned. She glares at Nightwing.

“You _told_ him?”

“Nope!” Nightwing says cheerfully. He’s now taken off his domino, rubbing at the bright red skin where the adhesive has peeled away. “Tim here figured all of us out ages ago. We didn’t spill any of the beans.”

“If it helps,” Tim offers, “It took me like, a _whole nother year_ to realize who you were after I figured out the others.”

Babs does look slightly mollified. 

“How?” She demands. 

Tim grins. “Nightwing has a very distinctive skillset. I recognized his quad flip on TV when I was little, and put two and two together.”

“That’s our Timmers,” Dick says fondly, ruffling Tim’s hair. “Too smart for his own good.”

“I made cookies, if you want?” Tim says to Babs. She’s now taking off her cowl. “White chocolate cranberry. B said they’re your favorite.” 

“Oh, god,” Babs says, smiling now. “ _Yes_ . Absolutely. And how old are you? How long have you known?” 

“I’m almost 14,” Tim says. “Uh, figured it out when I was nine. I never told anybody, though.”

“But that’s not all,” Jason says gleefully. He must have slipped back into the cave on the electric bike. Tim kicks himself for not noticing. Bruce would be disappointed in his lack of situational awareness; he’s been working so hard on it lately, trying to improve on what he’s already picked up from years of running Gotham at night. 

_I’ve got to do better,_ he thinks. _I can’t let anyone down._ 

“Come on, Tim. Tell her what else,” Jason prompts. 

Tim sighs. 

“Uh,” he starts. Clears his throat. 

Babs has half of a cookie stuffed in her mouth, looks like a chipmunk, and has one of the worst cases of cowl-hair he’s seen yet. He shouldn’t be this intimidated.

“I, uh. I’m actually. You remember how Dick said a minute ago that we’ve actually sort of crossed paths before?”

“Mm hm,” Babs nods, around another mouthful of cookie. “These are _great_ , by the way.”

“Thanks,” Tim says, perking up slightly. “Alfred and Jason taught me.”

She gives him a thumbs up.

“Anyway,” Tim continues. “ _Well_. I’m actually BatWatch?”

Babs inhales so hard she chokes on cookie. Bruce chooses that moment to roar to a stop in the Batmobile, drowning out her coughing sounds until the engine finally shuts off.

“Oh, _nuts,_ B,” Babs wheezes at him with wide eyes. “You sure know how to pick them, don’t you.”

“Are you okay?” he asks, concerned. Babs waves him off.

“Fine. But he,”—she points at Tim—”is possibly not. Are you _crazy?”_ She’s addressing Tim, now.

“No more than _I_ was for whacking Batman with a tire iron while malnourished in a dark alley, standing next to the tire I had _clearly_ just jacked off of his super fancy war machinery a car,” Jason says. 

“Or me, when I was running around on my little Robin Hood crusade to avenge my parents like I was Inigo Montoya it something before Bruce found out and took me in,” Dick adds, grinning. _“Tim_ here at least managed to stay out of sight and off B’s radar for the past few years. That’s more than you can say about any of us.”

“Did you have backup?” she asks Tim, still reeling.

“You didn’t, in the beginning,” Tim points out reasonably.

Babs throws her hands in the air. “This whole family is crazy,” she hisses. “Oh my _god.”_

Bruce chuckles quietly.

“You,” Barbara says, jabbing a finger at Tim. “On the one hand, holy shit. Great job. You run a fantastic blog, even if tumblr is a less than ideal platform—”

“I couldn’t pay for a domain name!” Tim protests. “I was _ten!_ I can’t open bank accounts by myself yet.”

_“You do a great job,”_ she goes on, “but on the _other_ hand, don’t ever do anything like that on your own again. You could have _died_ . Or worse.”

“Yes yes, we’ve been over that several times,” Jason says hastily. Dick wraps both hands around Tim’s shoulders.

“And _you,”_ Babs growls, whirling on Bruce. “You’d better be teaching this kid how to defend himself. If you can’t keep him off the streets, you’d better be damn sure he’s prepared for them.”

“Don’t worry, I’ve got a Bat-Panic Button,” Tim says, helpfully. “And Bruce has been teaching me for months now.”

* * *

And he has. 

Tim isn’t a blank slate when he comes to the Waynes, which is both a good and bad thing. He has some bad habits and shortcuts that need to be fixed. But he also knows the basics of freerunning, and has taken enough martial arts courses on his parents’ (unknowing, unnoticed) dime to hold his own in basic fights. 

“Good,” Bruce says approvingly, the first time Tim manages to block five strikes in a row. Jason and Dick clap from the edge of the mats. “Now we aim for _ten,_ and one contacting strike of your own. Go.”

Tim works hard. It’s _wonderful_ . Bruce knows intimately what muscles and tendons to train if you plan on climbing and crouching and freerunning around a city. He has the equipment that’s best for it. And Dick and Jason teach Tim simple gymnastics moves, the basics of street fighting. After Tim asks one too many questions, Bruce takes him to an unused cavern in the cave system so he can learn about the physics of grappling firsthand. 

Tim can hardly move his arms for a few days after that.

And slowly, Tim gets a little stronger, a little faster, a little more confident on his feet. But no one needs to teach him how to be comfortable slipping through the shadows. He’s got that one covered on his own.

“Bruce has probably shed a manly tear or two over you while planning training, you know,” Dick says while he and Tim wait their turn for one of the ramps at the skatepark. “It’s like, _my new kid already knows some freerunning, has no fear of heights, and actually bothered to learn the proper foundations of martial arts in class instead of wanting to jump straight to the cool kicks? I’m being #blessed.”_

“I cannot believe you just said ‘hashtag blessed’ out loud,” Tim moans, pretending to whack Dick with his skateboard. Dick laughs. “As if Bruce would ever say that.”

“You’d be surprised,” Dick says, darkly. 

“TIM,” Jason hollers, jogging in their direction and waving something around. “Did you put sunscreen on?”

“No??”

_“Tim,”_ Jason scolds. He turns Tim around by the shoulders and starts rubbing the sunscreen lotion around Tim’s face himself. 

“The highest risk of lifetime skin cancer occurence comes from childhood sunburns,” Jason says, scrubbing fingers hard into Tim’s forehead. “You’re paler than an albino sphinx cat, you dumb little night gremlin. You’re gonna burn bad if you don’t put on sunscreen, and then you’re gonna get skin cancer like, seven times, and it’s gonna be miserable, and then where will we all be?”

“Ok, _momma bird,_ ” Tim snorts, half bewildered and half loving the contact. 

Jason pauses mid-reach, some of the sunscreen dripping off of his fingers onto Tim’s sneaker. Dick cracks up laughing so hard he doubles over.

Jason blinks. “What?”

“Ok, momma bird,” Tim says, more confidently this time.

“Did you just. Did you ok boomer me?” Jason sounds like he can’t quite decide whether he’s bewildered or mad. 

“No, no,” Dick wheezes out. “He’s saying it fondly, not, like,—” Dick waves a hand vaguely. “Dismissively. It’s just. Little wing, you really sound like a mom right now.” 

“Well, Alfred is my bro,” Jason says, finally getting back to slathering Tim in far more sunscreen than is probably necessary. “I learned from the best. And it’s because I _care,_ damnit, you little heathen,” Jason says to Tim. “Because people _should_ care about you, even about the small things, even if it’s aggressively. Damn. When did I go so soft? Fuck you!” The effect is ruined by the fact that he’s now pulled Tim into an enormous hug.

“Jay,” Tim squeaks. “Can’t breathe.” He awkwardly pats Jason’s back.

“Serves you right,” Jason sniffs. “Stop making me worry all the time.”

“Oh, it’s way too late for that,” Dick says cheerfully, giving them both noogies despite their very vocal protests. “You’re a big brother now, Jayce. It’s your job, you’re gonna care forever.”

Brothers. Tim has _brothers_ . They remind him almost every day, now, and every day, he’s still in awe. 

* * *

“Hey Tim,” Jason says one day towards the end of September. Tim puts down the wooden staff he’s been practicing with and uses the hem of his tank top to wipe off his forehead. He walks over to where Jason is on the other side of the mats, leaning against the boxing ring. Jason tosses him a water bottle. Tim gratefully cracks it open, takes a swig. 

“What’s up?” Tim asks, drizzling a little of the cool water on his head.

“You’ve been getting a lot better with that whacker,” Jason says approvingly. 

“Uh huh,” Tim says. “But you didn’t come over just to say that.”

“No, I didn’t.” Jason smiles, but something about it looks a little off, a little wistful. “I…I wanted to talk with you about something. Not anything bad,” he adds quickly, as Tim tenses beside him. “I promise. It’s just important.”

Tim forces his muscles to relax, one group at a time, toes to hips to shoulders to neck. Breathes deeply like they taught him. _It’s okay._

“Okay,” Tim says softly. He sits down, Jason following him to the floor. As always, Jason’s feet start kicking back and forth where they dangle. Tim’s lips tick up in a smile.

“You’re 14. You’ve got time still. But I’m 17 now,” Jason sighs. “I’ll be headed to college next year, if everything goes well—”

“Which it _will,”_ Tim says. “You’re brilliant. They’d be stupid not to take you.”

“Yeah, well, don’t count your bats before they fly,” Jason counters. “I just...I’m trying not to get my hopes up too early. I still have to write my stupid personal statement essays for applications first.”

“Fair.”

“Anyway. I’m not going to be in Gotham, probably, while I’m going to school. And I’m almost grown up, at least kinda. Dick had this happen too. I don’t—Robin doesn’t.” Jason sighs quietly, more of a huff than anything else. “Robin doesn’t quite _fit_ anymore. I love it, but it’s not me. I’m bigger now. Not as...not as bright.”

“That doesn’t make sense.” Tim frowns. “You’re Robin. You have been for years. Of course it fits, it’s _you.”_

“Your _face_ doesn’t make sense,” Jason snips back, fondly. He drags Tim into his side, holds him close. “And you’re right. I have been Robin for ages now. And that’s the problem. B is fine as Batman, because he chose it and built it and has made it what it is. And I’ve helped shape Robin for the past several years, but it was a role I stepped into, not a role I made. Does that make any sense?”

“Yeah, I think I see what you mean,” Tim says. He looks up at Jason, head resting on his shoulder. “You don’t feel like it was made for you, like it can only grow so far and you’re more than what Robin does now. Like Dick.”

“Exactly, baby bird.” There’s a note of pride in Jason’s voice. 

“But who’s to say what Robin can be or not?” Tim asks. “Robin can grow too.”

“I don’t _want_ to stay in the same spot, though, Tim,” Jason says softly. “I get it now, why Dick didn’t just keep Robin and stay as Batman’s partner. It’s just time.”

“Jason,” Tim starts, concerned. He tries to pull away, but Jason hugs him tightly.

“I’m giving up Robin, buddy. I’m going to be someone new.”

_“No,”_ Tim protests, and _wow, why is he this upset?_  

“Yes,” says Jason, so gently. He doesn’t let go of the now-squirming Tim. “Tim. It’s okay. We all have to grow up sometime, right? No one’s forcing me to do this. I want more freedom, more independence. And B would let me go on my own with Robin if I really wanted, but it’s not the same. It’s not what Robin is for.”

“Exactly,” Tim says, hotly. “Jason. You can’t. _Please_ . Batman _needs_ Robin.”

“You’re right,” says Bruce. 

Jason and Tim both shriek and nearly fall off the mat. As they try to catch their breath, Jason clutches his hand to his chest and glares up at Bruce.

“Nice to know you can still sneak up on me and scare the living _bajeezus_ out of me, B,” he says. _“Gorram.”_

“Sorry,” Bruce says, not sounding very sorry at all. The corner of his mouth twitches. 

“Bruce,” Tim says, pleadingly. But Bruce shakes his head. 

“Hear Jason out, Tim.”

“I don’t know what I’ll end up being for real,” Jason starts again. “Might stick with this, or maybe I’ll go through a few different costumes while I figure things out over the coming years. But I’ve got to be my own hero, bud. I’m hanging up Robin. From now on, I’m going to be Flamebird. Figured it’ll make a nice matching set with Dickiebird.”

“You—” Tim takes a deep breath. “Okay. That’s. That’s pretty cool. Please tell me you have a costume already?”

“ _Oh_ yeah.” Jason grins.

“I want to see it.”

“Of course. Tonight. You can see the grand debut.”

“But _Robin_,” Tim says, again.

“Is _my_ concern,” Bruce interjects. “It’s okay, Tim. Jason needs to move on, keep growing. And I have a person in mind already, if they’re willing.”

Tim’s brows furrow. “Who?” 

“You.” 

Tim blinks. The cave is near silent for a few seconds, the only sounds a faint echo of water and the occasional rustle of bat wings. 

“Me,” Tim says flatly.

Bruce nods. 

“You want me—but I’m not—what?” 

Tim’s a skipping record, a dusty Sega Genesis cartridge, cannot read, cannot process, cannot compute. 

“Tim,” and Bruce reaches out, takes him gently by the shoulders. Looks him right in the eyes. “I want you to be my Robin. I think you’ll do a fantastic job of it, if you want to. I’d be honored to have you as my partner.”

Tim stares for a moment, then bursts into tears. Bruce immediately scoops him up, making nonsense shushing noises, and.

“It’s okay. It’s okay, bud. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.”

“You _want_ me,” Tim sobs. Bruce’s arms are around him, strong, eveloping. Jason’s hand finds Tim’s forehead, his sweaty hair, Tim can tell. Tim knows all their fingers by heart now. “You _want me.”_

“Always, buddy. Always,” Bruce murmurs. 

“We love you, Timbo,” Jason says. “If anyone’s gonna be Robin after me, I’d love for it to be you. There’s no one better suited.”

“Are you sure,” Tim asks, between quieting cries. 

“Positive,” Bruce says, and drops a gentle kiss on Tim’s nose. “I trust you.”

“Okay,” Tim sighs. “Okay. If you’re sure. But we gotta do something about BatWatch. I can’t just leave people with no information. They need it.”

“We’ll figure it out.” Bruce smiles. “Everything is going to be okay, Tim. We’ve got you.”

Tim shoves his face into Bruce’s old tshirt, breathes in the scent of his lotion and wound ointment and conditioner and everything uniquely _Bruce_.

“I love you,” Tim whispers.

“Love you too, Timmy,” Bruce says, and.

And and _and_.

Tim _hated_ being called Timmy. Jason knew. Alfred knew. Jason told Dick. Dick knew. He’s not sure anyone ever told Bruce, per se, but the man clearly picked up on it after no one else ever used the easiest nickname they could have thrown around for Tim. 

Tim doesn’t like being full-named because it was what he’d been called when he was in trouble and about to be punished. But he doesn’t like _Timmy_ because it was what he’d been called when he was tiny, when he’d been naive and thought his parents would always come home and wanted to see him. When he was small enough and cute enough that they’d pick him up still, and carry him when his little legs were tired and couldn’t keep up. When he was small enough to get away with babbling about types of clouds, and it was called cute. When he made people like him just by having big eyes and a small voice. When his parents seemed to still love him, when he felt warm, when he felt safe. Timmy was everything he felt like he’d lost.

But when Bruce says it now, it doesn’t hurt the way it used to. It doesn’t burn. There’s no painful reminder of all the things he longs for that he’s not going to have again, but can’t seem to sever the last thread of hope for. 

When Bruce says it, all Tim feels is loved. All Tim feels is warm. 

All Tim feels is home.

_I know the update schedule has had some gaps over the past year,_ the post begins. _I’m sorry for all my absences. But I’m glad you’ve all been enjoying the regularly scheduled updates for the last several months!_

_Unfortunately,_ Tim goes on, _I’m really sorry to say that...well. I can’t guarantee that there won’t be more interruptions. So much has changed in my life so quickly in this past year that it’s really a struggle to keep this up. I’m doing my best, but please, please I really recommend you all go follow GCPD’s new Gotham Updates twitter account. I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to get timely updates on developing situations on BatWatch as quickly as is needed. But I’m working closely with the police and other emergency services on this, and I promise it’s going to be good. Make sure you turn alerts on for when they post, because if they tweet, you need to listen!_

“Done,” Tim says, closing the web browser. He kicks away from the Batcomputer, rolling across the cave floor until he’s stopped by Bruce grabbing the back of the chair. 

“Tim,” he says, a smile in his voice. “You’ve _got_ to stop taping your name to the back of my chair.”

“Make me,” Tim says cheerfully.

“You tell ‘im, baby bird,” Jason calls from over by the lockers. “Stick it to the man!”

“Respect your elders!” Bruce hollers back. 

Tim laughs. 

“I assume that everything is going smoothly according to your plans so far?” Alfred asks Tim.

“So far,” Tim agrees. “Two more nights of this, and then it’s time.”

“As long as you don’t get reckless tonight or tomorrow,” Bruce warns. 

“I _know,_ B.”

Bruce places his hand gently on Tim’s head for a moment. “I know you know. I just worry. I’m your guardian, it’s my job.”

Tim smiles at him. “I’ll be okay, Bruce. I promise. I’ve learned from the best.”

* * *

“Time?” Tim asks, nearly vibrating where he stands. The early December breeze is definitely picking up; it’s not going to be long before winter hits for real.

“Time,” Bruce confirms with a smile. 

Dick and Jason both give him a thumbs-up. 

“Here we go,” Tim mutters, and hits the button to publish_._  

_Sorry, guys. This is BatWatch’s last night. I’ll still take some photos, but they’ll be routing through Gotham Updates now. I’ll just be a freelancer when I have the time._

The comments start rolling in, and Tim feels a little bad watching people get worked up. But not bad enough to stop. 

“Ready?” Tim asks, turning to Jason.

“Hell yeah,” Jason grins. “Let’s go!”

Tim expertly snaps the shot mid-leap—him in the new and improved Robin costume, and Jason as the iridescent Flamebird. They’re clearly in midair, hair flying up in defiance of gravity, and Nightwing is photobombing in the corner with _rock on_ hands. Batman is clearly standing on the rooftop behind them, cloaked and intimidating. But there’s a faint softness in his expression, just the hint of fond exasperation. 

Gotham’s skyline lights up deep and bright and beautiful in the background, Bokeh effect in full force. The Bats are backlit by the shine of the city they love. It’s often hard to see how beautiful Gotham City truly is, for everyone who’s stuck on the ground. 

After swinging to a safe perch, Tim spares a few seconds to edit, tweaking exposure here, softening contrast there, and posts the photo, captioned with _Guess who’s official! See you on the streets. :)_

_You little SHIT,_ Oracle comments seconds later. _I hope you’re happy with yourself. You could have warned me. But I’m proud of you, Robin. You’re gonna do great._

_You are well loved by many, Robin,_ Agent A posts soon after. _Don’t forget that._

There’s a flutter behind Tim, and he turns to see Batman smiling. Tim slips the phone into one of his hidden pockets.

“B,” he says happily. 

“Robin,” Batman replies, warmly. “Are you ready to go?”

Tim looks out over the city, his city. His to protect, his to watch, his to call home. He looks back at Batman, who he gets to call it home with. 

“Yeah, Dad,” Tim says, feeling more content than he could imagine was possible a year ago. “Let’s go.”

And Tim believes Bruce, now. Things aren’t perfect, and they’re never going to be. He still has bad days, he’s still got a lot of scars. But.. 

He’s got his family, as weird, and crazy, and _unusual_ as they are. And after all the years of wishing and longing from afar, _Batman’s_ got Tim, too, whenever Tim needs it, as Robin or BatWatch or just plain Tim. 

As many times as he needs. As many times as it takes. 

And Tim is going to be okay.

#### Notes:

This became a really personal story for me in a lot of ways I hadn't planned, and I know it's brought up a lot of emotions and realizations for some of you too. **I want you to know that you can always message me on my tumblr (@goldkirk) if you need to talk, or text the Crisis Text Line (which you don't need to be in whatever you think is, like, a "deserving enough crisis" to use—it's for EVERYONE who needs to talk about something) at 741-741. It's great.**

I'm continuing this through some one shots and maybe a chapter fic or two (if you have unanswered questions, they're probably going to be answered in those), so stay tuned to this series and thank you for all the love and joy you've brought to my life recently! I APPRECIATE YOU. 

Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Holidays, please remember to drink something, eat something, and take any meds you need! You're amazing. <3
