# well, i was young and naive

> Tim's parents come home. Some Things happen. The Waynes aren't letting Tim fall to the wayside despite his best efforts, and Tim gets to go ice skating.

#### Notes: 

Warning for emotional abuse ahead. If you need to, skip the section that starts with "That night" and pick back up again at the section that begins with "On Sunday". 

I recommend listening to "The Winner Is" by DeVotchKa during the first chunk of this chapter, to hear what Tim's emotional tone is. It's perfect for that part. 

Chapter title is from The Truth Is A Cave by The Oh Hellos.

* * *

It’s a Thursday morning when his mom and dad call again to let him know they’ll be back that afternoon. And yeah, the call gets Tim’s phone confiscated for the day, but he’s so excited he can’t bring himself to care. He’s been waiting for this for _weeks_ . 

Between periods that morning, Tim catches sight of Jason and deftly shoves his way through the packed hallway until he finally twists around to a stop in front of the taller boy. Jason pulls up short.

“Tim?” 

“Jason!” Tim is beaming. He feels like his face might split in two. “Guess what?”

“What?” asks Jason, smiling back. “Did your test get canceled? New game get announced?”

“No, dude, my parents are coming back! Tonight! Their detour in Spain is over.” 

Jason double-high-fives him right there. “Thats’s great Tim! I’m happy for you.” 

“I can’t wait,” Tim says, happily. 

Jason grabs him by the backpack and turns him around so they face the same direction, shoving him forward so they can walk. “So,” he says, keeping one hand on Tim’s shoulder. “We’ve got a minute before class starts. Tell me about it. Do you all have plans for tonight? What do you want to do?”

“When I get home I’m going to bake some cookies, because everyone likes cookies, right? And I’ve been putting together photos for my mom and dad for a while now—they take photos of archaeology stuff, you know, but they don’t get much else? And I’m not there to take pictures of _them_, so I can’t give them a family scrapbook or anything.” Tim pauses his rapid-fire speaking to finally take a deep breath. 

“But I know my dad likes birds, or at least the tropical ones, he has this book. And mom used to have a garden when I was little. It was really pretty. I remember her kneeling out in it and teaching me about how to take care of irises and orchids and stuff. So I’ve been taking pictures of birds and flowers around here for them, every time I’m at the park, or walking past peoples’ yards. I know it’s not the same as, like, toucans and venus fly traps and whatever else they see when they’re abroad, but.” Tim looks up at Jason. “I put them in little photo albums for them with descriptions and dates, like a travel log. Flowers for my mom, birds for my dad. I’m going to give those to them tonight. With the cookies, obviously. They’re usually tired when they’ve flown all day, so I figure they can relax and just look at the books.”

Jason is floored, for a moment, by how thoughtful Tim is. He’s thirteen. And it’s not like thirteen year olds are selfish, or anything, but they’re kids, and kids usually aren’t this attuned to other people’s needs. Tim’s so good at it. It makes Jason wonder what it would have been like to grow up with parents or siblings like Tim and Dick from day one. How different would he be now? Would he even be the same person?

“Tim,” Jason says quietly. “That’s an awesome plan. I bet they’re going to love that.”

“I hope so,” says Tim, and he looks so excited and desperately wishful at the same time that it makes Jason’s heart ache. 

They stop in front of Jason’s classroom. “Listen,” he says. “I want to hear more about those photos at lunch, okay? And maybe we can give you a ride home after school to save you time?”

Tim pauses, clearly considering the offer. Jason takes this as the victory it is—he and Alfred have been trying to get Tim to accept rides for the better part of three weeks at this point, and only succeeded twice. It’s like the kid is physically incapable of accepting help. Which...if Jason cares to remember back to how he was, himself, when Bruce first took him in, is pretty familiar. It makes sense, considering how independent Tim has had to be so far in his life. But still infuriating for Jason and Alfred a little.

“I’ll...I’ll see,” Tim says, finally. “When school is over.”

That’s better than a no. “Okay,” says Jason. “I hope your class is good!”

“You too!” says Tim, and he’s off down the hall _just_ slowly enough for the hall monitor to not be able to call him out for running. 

* * *

“Mom!” Tim practically vaults over the side of the couch at the sound of the front door opening. “You’re home!”

“Hello, Tim!” Janet replies. She’s setting down her purse on the entryway table under the mirror. Tim steps close, and wraps his arms around her in a hug. She returns the embrace, albeit a little loosely, but that’s okay. Tim knows she can’t have had much practice while she’s been away working. They can get better at it together, while his parents are home for a while. “Boy, you’ve gotten taller!” she says, once they break apart.

“Yes, mom,” he says. He’s reminded of the similar exchange with Mr. Pennyworth a few weeks before. “I’m up almost an inch and a half since you were here last.”

“Taking after your father.” She nods approvingly. “He had quite a growth spurt in high school. And it’s about time, for you. You’ve been lagging behind your peers.”

Tim nods. Then Jack is rapping on the glass storm door, and Tim dutifully holds it open while his father carries to suitcases in. 

“Hi, Dad!” Tim says, once his father is all the way in and the bags are tucked at the base of the stairs. Tim goes in for a hug with him as well, but Jack catches his shoulder with a hand and gives tim a light pat before turning to walk down the hallway. Janet joins him, one of her hands on Jack’s broad arm.

“It’s good to see you, son. I trust you’ve been doing well with your schoolwork while we’ve been away?” Jack asks.

“Yeah, Dad,” Tim replies. He’s a bit disappointed his dad didn’t want a full hug, but hey. He’ll take what he can get. They’ve got time. “All A’s. As usual.”

“Good.”

Tim speedwalks a few steps to catch up with his parents. “I made cookies for you this afternoon, after school.”

“That’s sweet of you, Timmy.” Janet smiles at him. “But I’m on a diet right now. I can’t have any extra sugar.”

“Oh,” says Tim. “Well. That’s okay, I can make you something else? A wrap or tea or something?” 

“No, baby, it’s fine. I think I’m going to go put my feet up in the living room for a while.” She lets go of Jack’s shoulder and takes a turn, heading through the doorway towards the fire Tim started earlier in the fireplace. It’s always been his favorite way to curl up with a book in the winter.

“Dad?” he asks, looking up at Jack as they both keep walking. “Do you want a cookie or two?”

“Not right now, Tim,” Jack says. 

“Okay,” Tim sighs. “I can make you tea or coffee, if you want?”

“That would be good.” Jack turns to look at him finally. “I’ll take some coffee with half and half.”

Tim runs off to make himself and his father mugs. Finally, something he can do to get his dad to smile. 

* * *

“So,” Tim says, a while later. They’re all seated on different chairs in the sitting room by the fire. “I’m really glad you’re home.”

His parents both make tired sounds of acknowledgment. They all watch the fire in silence together for a few more moments.

“I made a couple things for you while you were gone,” he offers. “Hang on. I’m going to go grab them.”

His parents tell him the photo books are well made, then set them aside after flicking through a few pages apiece. Shortly afterwards, Jack and Janet turn in for the night, pleading exhaustion after a long day of traveling across the ocean. Tim understands. He does.

He tries to stomp down his disappointment, and almost succeeds. 

* * *

The next morning, Mrs. Mac isn’t there, nor has she come and left already. Instead, Janet is in the kitchen frying bacon and eggs for Tim’s breakfast, and smiles at him with an enthusiastic “Good morning, baby!” on her lips. Tim doesn’t have the heart to remind her he’s vegetarian. He’s too excited to spend a morning with her like he wishes for while they’re gone. 

They sit quietly at the broad marble island together on the bar stools, eating and drinking coffee—but not Bruce’s, Tim keeps the bag safe in his room. (He’s not sure how his parents would feel about Tim being friendly with the richest man in Gotham. It’s a toss up, really, between seeing it as a networking opportunity for their family and seeing it as someone trying to influence their son. Tim prefers to just avoid the whole issue in the first place. There’s a lot his parents don’t know about him; what’s one more secret in the pile?)

Tim has a lot of secrets, these days. 

His parents do too, apparently, since they wait till Tim is running out the door to get to school—nearly running late—to tell him they’re leaving Gotham again in two days. 

* * *

Tim manages to avoid Jason at lunch. He hides in the library and doesn’t eat, since that’s the standard rule in there. He’s not very hungry anyway, today.

Tim is angry at _himself_ , more than anything else. He’s done this dance a thousand times. His parents never stay long. Tim can’t understand why he got himself so worked up into thinking this time would be anything different, anything special. 

Whatever. Tim is fine on his own. He’ll get over it in a few days.

Jason catches him after the bell rings, though, and Tim hates the emotions Jason wears on his face like a language he’s trying to teach the world. 

“Tim, are you okay?” Jason asks. He’s worried. 

“Yeah, fine!” Tim plasters on a smile, as bright as he can muster. “Sorry, I was studying a lot today. I’m worried about this project that’s almost due.”

“Did your parents make it home okay?” 

“Yeah,” says Tim. _Please, Jason, drop it, he_ pleads internally. 

Jason, of course, does not drop it, because Jason has never been capable of letting go of an issue he deems important, ever, not _once_ , in his _entire life_.

“Did they like the books?” Jason is watching Tim too closely. Tim has got to get out of here. He needs space to process and think before he can be who he needs to be for everyone. Just a few hours, then he'll be fine. That’s all.

“Yeah, they thought they were great,” Tim lies, glancing at the doors. “Listen, they’re leaving in a few days, so I really gotta get home. I don’t want to wast any time. I’ll see you Monday, okay?” He turns to press through the school’s entrance.

“Wait,” Jason says, catching Tim by the sleeve. “They’re leaving again?” 

“Can we _not_ do this right now?” Tim snaps, finally letting frustration leak through. Jason’s eyes widen slightly. Tim sighs. “Sorry. I’m just...I’m tired. I was up late last night and I really do need to go home.” 

“It’s okay,” says Jason. “Seriously, Timbo. Don’t worry about it. But listen, really quick, before you go—Alfred and Bruce and I were talking, and we want to give you our cell phone numbers in case you ever need anything.” 

“Jason, I have plenty of money and supplies. I’m fine.”

“Yeah, but if the power goes out, or you just want to talk, or need help with homework or something. Or, who knows, it’s Gotham. If there’s an Arkham breakout and you’re stuck in the city, you can call then, too.” 

Tim thinks for a moment about that scenario. He’s good at hiding and staying unseen. Now Batman and Robin want him to call them if he’s stuck on the streets? What are they going to do? Drag Alfred out of the house into danger to come get him, bail on catching criminals so Batman and Robin can pretend to have been “asked” to go nab a random high school freshman, split up while one of them changes into civvies to take Tim home? He’s not worth it. 

“It would also let you have a heads up next time Dick and I are gonna kidnap you, instead of us showing up while you’re in pajamas and eating Froot Loops alone like a sad gremlin,” Jason adds helpfully.

Tim’s not getting out of this building without their phone numbers in his phone. This is Robin #2 he’s dealing with. He knows what that entails.

“Fine,” Tim says, handing his phone over. Jason makes a delighted sound, and quickly adds four contacts, and hits “call” for his own, so he can get Tim’s number in return. 

“Cool,” Jason says. He pulls Tim in for a sudden hug, and Tim squawks. “We’re here if you need us, okay? Or even just want us.” He lets Tim go. 

“I know,” Tim says. He smiles for a second. “Thanks for caring, Jason. It’s nice of you.” Then he’s out the door, running for the Uber he ordered to take him home. 

* * *

That night, Tim backtalks his dad, over something stupid and small and Tim is _so dumb sometimes_ , why can’t he keep it together? Yeah, he was reading for a bit to relax after doing his homework, but his Dad wanted him to _do_ something. He should have just _done_ it like a good son. Of course asking for a few minutes to finish the chapter was rude. 

Tim _knows_ _that_. But he’s still yelling back and forth with his father anyway, frustrated over his own feelings and his parents’ quick turnaround, not the _book_ really, but here they are anyway, and Janet nowhere to be seen. And then Jack is tearing the old Kindle from Tim’s hands, just like that, and he’s storming towards the kitchen, Tim trailing after, still shouting—

And Tim’s watching his dad open the drawer, and there’s the hammer, why does he have the _hammer_—

It comes down on the screen with an awful sound, and as the plastic and screen layers crack and crumble Tim feels his entire body turn to lava, and his core freeze like his heart’s become an ice cube, and he’s not yelling anymore. He’s not thinking. Tim’s not sure he’s even breathing anymore as his Dad drops the hammer on the counter finally, and fills the sink with soap. Twists the drain plug into place, turns on the tap. Drops in the Kindle. 

He turns to Tim, red-faced and breathing heavy, as the Kindle disappears under a rising flood of soap bubbles. “Maybe this time, you’ll finally learn some obedience,” he says. 

Tim can not speak. He’s desperately glad Jack didn’t think to demand his phone as well, he’s glad he left it upstairs on silent, he's glad that Kindle isn't him. 

Jack watches him for another moment, in case his son will respond, then turns his back when no words are forthcoming. 

“Get out,” says Jack.

Tim flees to his bedroom and doesn’t come out until lunch the next day. He’s sullenly glad his parents are leaving so soon, now. Jack has clearly not grown fonder of Tim in his absence. 

* * *

On Sunday, the doorbell rings in the early afternoon. Tim scrambles up from where he’s been perched on one of the bay window loveseats, shouting “I’ll get it!” deeper into the hallway behind him. 

He yanks the door open to find Dick Grayson on their porch. Tim stares for a moment.

“What are you doing here?” he asks. It’s a little sharper than he intended.

“I came to see if you wanted to come with me to the aquarium,” Dick said with an easy smile. “Jason is busy with an essay, and he thought you might like to go instead, and I thought it was a great idea.”

Tim _would_ like to go. He’d love to see the aquarium, go talk about the animals with someone who was kind of like...a friend. He’d love to get out of this oppressively quiet house with the tension bleeding through the air. But he can’t.

“I can’t,” he says. “I’m sorry. This is kind of a bad time. You shouldn’t be here.”

Dick frowns, confused.

“Tim? Who is it!” A bellow from further in the house. His dad. 

“No one, Dad!” Tim calls back, loudly. “It’s just someone who got lost, heading for Wayne Manor. I’m giving them directions.” He shoots Dick a pointed look, before looking back over his shoulder agin to face the hallway.

“Make it fast. Don’t let too much cold air in.”

Tim turns back to Dick. “You should go,” he says quietly. 

“Tim, are you sure you don’t want to come? I’d really love to have you.”

“I’m sure,” Tim says. “Maybe a different time? I’m sorry Dick. Have fun at the aquarium. Say hi to the sharks for me.” He shuts the door before his face can betray him.

* * *

Dick leaves, but takes Bruce with him to the aquarium instead. The two of them talk about a lot, but especially Tim, or rather, what to do about him. It’s clear that his parents aren’t around as much as they should be, but Tim is very self sufficient. And very private. Getting details about his life out of him is like trying to nail jello to a tree. 

“Bruce,” Dick says seriously. “That boy needs some hot chocolate. And hugs. And I think his _eyebags_ have eyebags right now, he needs sleep.”

“You’d think,” Bruce said, carefully, “that he’d be getting more now that his parents are in town.”

“You would,” agrees Dick, mildly. “And yet.”

“And yet.”

Bruce and Dick quietly begin to look into the Drakes’ travel records, and whatever financial and other information they can get their hands on from the time Tim’s been born till now. It may be nothing, but…

Bruce figures a little paranoia never hurt anyone. And since the BatWatch blog is on hiatus for a week while the owner is busy, there’s nothing new he can do on that front to further their never-ending game of cat-and-mouse. He knows by now that the owner _does_ have good intentions, and even goes to extreme lengths to avoid giving away Batman and Robin’s patrol patterns, hideouts, and tactics—even though he’d have to know at least some of them after keeping tabs on the Bats for this long. 

It’s a mystery Batman has to be willing to let go of for now. But that doesn’t mean he ignores it, or that Oracle doesn’t keep working on it in what free time she has between college life and their nighttime escapades.

But, for today, Timothy Drake is more important. BatWatch and Gotham can wait.

* * *

Tim can’t shake the crappy feelings before school on Monday. He tells his parents goodbye before he leaves the house, since they’re heading off to the airport soon after his first class begins. He doesn’t know where they’re going specifically, only that it’s somewhere in Asia this time. They haven’t offered specifics, and for the first time, he doesn’t feel like asking.

He’s so _tired_ . For two days, Tim has been feeling a frustrating mix of numb, angry, and scared, and he absolutely hates it. He prides himself on emotional control, on rationality, but _one_ little thing happens with his dad, and he’s reduced to an exhausted mess? Jason definitely picks up on it, Tim can tell, but for once in their friendship, Jason doesn’t actually pry. Maybe he’s chalking Tim’s mood up to the fact that his parents are leaving again. And it is, partly. 

Tim gives up on studying the geometry theorem of the day, and lays his head on his folded arms, looking out the window through the dead tree branches. It isn’t much of a view, but at least there’s open sky in part of it. Tim concentrates on trying to stay silent enough to not attract notice while blowing a chunk of bangs off of his nose, and pointedly not think about how he feels relieved that his parents are gone again, and guilty that he’s glad that they’re gone when all he wants when they aren’t around is for them to come back. It’s a mess. He’s a mess. He just wants someone to talk to him and make things okay, but that’s not how life works. Tim knows _that_ by now.

He’s just got to get through the next few days, let himself simmer down again, and then things will be okay. Like they always are.

* * *

On Saturday, he gets a text from Jason and Dick.

_We’re coming over in 20. Be there or be square._

Tim almost goes out in the woods to hide somewhere just to spite them, but decides it’s not worth it. They probably have some kind of hidden Bat-gadget that shows heat signatures or something.

Actually dressed this time, he opens the front door when they bang on it, and Jason immediately grabs him by the shoulders and starts frog-marching him down the hall. “Yo kid, look alive. We’re goin’ ice skating.”

“What the hell?” Tim splutters, more in shock at being manhandled than anything else. 

“Ice skating,” Dick echoes, cheerfully. He hauls Tim up onto his bed like he weighs nothing, and starts wrestling his arms into a coat. Tim doesn’t even think to ask how they know where his room is. Jason throws a pair of thick socks, a hat, and gloves directly into Tim’s face.

“From Alfred,” he explains. “He’s on his annual knitting spree.” 

“Oh,” Tim says, dumbly. He pulls on the socks, and Jason bends down to tug his boots on for him. “I’m—I’m not a little kid,” Tim protests.

“Never said you were.” Dick smiles at him. “But it’s faster when we help each other, and look. We’re already done. Let’s go, gang.” 

And then Tim is being picked up in a bridal carry, and that’s just one thing too many. He elbows Jason in the ribs, expertly twisting out of his arms and landing on all fours like a cat. But before he can take more than a few steps, a strong arm wraps around him from behind, and he’s being tossed over a broad shoulder like a sack of potatoes.

“Nice try, kiddo,” Dick laughs. “But it’s tradition. Everyone knows you have to go ice skating on the very middle day of December.” They start down the stairs.

“That is the most fake thing I have ever heard in my _life_. Are you kidding me,” Tim says.

“Yeah, Dickface, do better,” Jason agrees. “Everyone knows the midpoint of December is when you’re supposed to do sword dancing in front of the Christmas tree to lay the groundwork for proper Santa Summoning.”

Tim can’t help laughing now. “You two are so full of lies I don’t know what to believe at this point!” And, yikes, that’s a bit more on the nose than he realized when he started to say it. Secret identities and vigilante nightlife and all, added in to the fact that Tim still had no clue why they kept trying to do things with him, made a sobering combination. 

They reach the car, and to Tim’s shock, _Bruce Wayne himself_ is leaned up against the driver’s side door, popping it open and leaning the seat forward when they get close, so that Tim and Jason can scramble into the backseat.

“Hello Tim,” Bruce says, a cheerful smile in place. It actually looks like one of his real ones. “It’s nice to see you again.”

“Hi Mr.—I mean. Hi Bruce,” Tim gets out. “It’s good to see you too.” Jason nudges him with his elbow, and Tim looks over to see Jason waggling his eyebrows. Tim slugs him back in the shoulder once he’s gotten his seatbelt clicked into place. 

Dick leaps into the passenger seat and flicks on Christmas oldies, and once Bruce is sure everyone’s buckled, they’re off to the races. 

* * *

They ended up at a small pond on someone’s farm, somewhere rural. Tim’s not sure if the place is being used at the moment. But the ice is thick, and the day is warm enough to be pleasant in a proper coat, and it’s honestly impossible to not have fun when Dick and Jason are both around. They play tag for a while, and crack-the-whip (although Bruce quickly puts a stop to that after the first time someone snaps off right into a thicket of frozen reeds). There’s hot chocolate in thermoses courtesy of Alfred and Dick, for when they want a little extra warmth. 

Then Dick and Jason come up with the brilliant idea of spinning really fast while holding hands and seeing who centrifugal force sends flying first—aka, who’s the weakling. Bruce points out that inertia and mass give unfair advantage, and Jason tells him to buzz off. Bruce just laughs, and Tim watches with some surprise. 

Tim is at a definite disadvantage compared with the older boys, so after a few rounds he begs off and just skates around in loops by himself instead. Dick and Jason link their hands to go for it again, each threatening to send the other careening into oblivion. As Tim is passing near Bruce, thinking about how pretty the landscape would be to shoot out here, Bruce suddenly reaches out and yanks Tim backwards, hard, into his arms, wrapping him up securely against his own chest so he can’t fall. Tim blinks, and half a second later Jason is flying past them right where Tim was about to be moments before. 

“Sorry Tim,” Dick calls from across the pond. “We weren’t thinking about angles well enough!”

Bruce’s arms are still solid and warm across Tim’s chest. His red scarf is brushing the side of Tim's face, the wool slightly itchy against his skin. Tim looks up, and Bruce is watching Dick and Jason as they bicker over who won the round and who’s turn it is to be flung next, and Tim feels like something inside him is warming up and swelling like the Grinch’s heart when he realizes Bruce is smiling wide and real, and so softly no one would believe it if Tim told them. Even Bruce’s eyes are crinkled with fond amusement as he watches his sons. 

And Bruce is holding Tim like he belongs, tight and close, like this meant more than just Bruce pulling Tim out of harm’s way for a moment. 

Tim is still watching his face. “Bruce?” he asks quietly.

“Yeah?” And oh, god. Bruce is smiling down at _him_ now, with that same face, it didn’t go away when he turned to look at Tim. 

Tim fiercely shoves down the itching that’s building behind his eyes. 

“Thank you,” he says.

“Anytime, sport,” assures Bruce. “I’m glad you came with us today.” Tim sniffles a couple of times. A cold breeze has picked up around the surface of the pond, is all.

“Yeah,” he says, and to his surprise, he really means it. “Me too.” 

Bruce lets go, then, pats him on the shoulder once and gently shoves him in the direction of Jason, skating towards them. Jason pulls Tim along over to Dick, who to Tim’s absolute horror and delight, scoops him up and plops him on his shoulders like a toddler. Dick starts skating smoothly, just like that, and Tim _should_ be mad but he _isn’t_ , and he’s got so many feelings he doesn’t even know how to name them all. So he laughs, instead, and hangs on underneath Dick’s chin, tries not to strangle him.

And for a while, for the first time _in_ a while, everything is pretty darn good in the world.

#### Notes: 

Well I sure made MYSELF emotional writing this chapter. I hope you enjoyed it still! Even when it gets rough, I'm never going to leave things terrible. No one dies in this, and everyone WILL get happy endings. That's a promise.
