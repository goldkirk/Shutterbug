# just say you're hurt, we'll face the world

> Tim gets sick. This time, he's got some people in his corner.

#### Notes: 

I apologize for any typos, I write these chapters on my phone during spare moments during long work shifts and since I was up at 4:15 AM I'm not the most awake I've ever been in my life, lol. 

Chapter title is from Take on the World, by You Me At Six.

* * *

In the week and a half after his parents leave again, things settle back into a familiar routine for Tim. He goes to school, chases vigilantes, updates BatWatch nightly, continues to never get enough sleep, narrowly evades Oracle and Batman using So Many, Many Server Spoofs, and manages to drop some photos of criminal activity off with GCPD for Commissioner Gordon to share with Batman. 

That last one is always tricky, because both Batman and the police had great security and precautionary measures, and Tim can’t very well walk in and drop off an envelope anonymously if he wanted to do it more than once. 

So the street kids end up helping, in a strange partnership. The older ones are always trying to get the youngest ones somewhere safer than the streets and hidey holes. Tim needs someone to go to the police for him on occasion. And they _all_ know that any kid that popped up on Batman’s radar tends to end up well taken care of in the end. So what if they worked together to kill two birds with one stone?

When Tim has evidence he feels is important enough that it needs to get to the authorities, he lets Callie know—she’s the main ringleader of the kids he helps. One of the kindest 17-year-olds Tim’s ever met, despite all the lousy cards she’s been dealt so far in life. Callie then picks one of the younger kids who she thinks is best for it at the moment, points them out to Tim, and lets the magic happen.

And Tim, for his part, has never used his real name on the streets. His disguise is an identity, not just a costume. Tim wears glasses, a black wig in a style longer than his own haircut—Tim tends to run around with a small man bun most nights, to keep it out of the way. He dresses mostly in black, with hints of punk and rock and roll influence. The only name he gives, when necessary, is Jack Kelly. (Surprisingly, not a single soul has called him out on that yet.)

When the kid inevitably gets directed into the police station, sealed and fingerprint-free manilla envelope in hand, all they know is a fake name and a description that matches what every kid before them has said. It keeps Tim safe, creates a sort of routine for the police that arouses minimum suspicion, gets hurting kids fast-tracked onto Gordon and Batman’s radar, and into better housing at the very least. Tim just wishes he could make it work for _all_ the other kids he runs into while pounding the streets in Gotham's neighborhoods, not just these few.

So all in all, Tim was doing well. He has no reason to suspect anything would go wrong. Batman and Robin end up dealing with an Arkham breakout Wednesday night, which means Tim, of course, is out as late as they are, keeping tabs on the situation for the blog. Many Gotham natives have alerts turned on for his posts; over the past couple of years, BatWatch has gained a reputation for timely, reputable information. Even the police use it for reference on occasion.

When Tim trudges his way home that night, he’s flat out exhausted. Nothing would be better than to sleep for a week, but Tim has a math test tomorrow and honestly, he has no idea how Dick and Jason have managed all this time. 

He manages to change from his night gear into sweatpants and an old shirt, and grab a Gatorade, and then he’s out like a light on the sofa.

* * *

He wakes up with a start some time later, confused and feeling off. Wisps of an unpleasant dream are flitting around in his memory for a few moments as he tries to orient himself—something about being trapped inside of a giant cathedral with his mother slowly catching up to him to scold him for something, while he tries to run away but can’t get any of the faceless bystanders from the shadows to help him. It makes no sense, of course. 

The clock above the fireplace says it’s still only a bit after 3 a.m., and Tim rolls off the sofa to tumble on the hardwood floor with a groan. He lies where he’s fallen for a few minutes, soaking up the blessed coolness against his cheek and arm. He’s shivering, deep down to his bones, but he’s sweaty too, and if Tim doesn’t have a fever, he’ll eat his sneakers. He’d been fine a few hours ago. Of course it’s just his luck that he’d start getting sick right before a big test day. 

It’s not the worst thing ever, Tim thinks as he drags himself up the stairs to his room. He’s taken tests while sick before, and as long as he can just space out the rest of the day or get Mrs. Mac to come get him if the nurse calls him out sick, it’s always fine. He just needs to not be quite so fuzzy. And dizzy. Tim’s pretty sure he’s supposed to be able to see more than this. Everything’s _really_ gray.

Maybe he’s dehydrated. That would make sense, if he’s got a fever. He was running around for hours and not drinking much water. His throat is sore too, where it had just had a tickle earlier in the day. Tim should have known that something was up when that made itself known around dinnertime. But alas, hindsight is always 20/20, right?

Tim’s in his room, he’s made it, and he’s just got to get to the bathroom for some water. He’s so, so tired. His muscles are rebelling, not working right, too slow. He already whacked his shoulder on the doorway on his way in. Tim is stumbling for the bathroom, and his vision goes out, everything is gray and dark. It flickers back in for a second, hazy still, just clear enough for Tim to stick out a hand and catch himself as he slides down the wall, and now his vision is all charcoal and Gotham sky at night, and there’s flashing green at the edges, and his ears ring, and his body is somewhere on another plane of existence, he guesses, because it sure isn’t with _him_ anymore, and that’s the last thing Tim remembers for a good long while. 

* * *

Something uncomfortable is shaking Tim. He tries to protest, make some kind of movement to bat away what feels like hands touching, prodding, shifting, but all he can manage is a quiet hrrn noise that quickly gets shushed. 

“Tim,” he can hear, measured and calm. Smooth. It’s like ironed aluminum foil to his ears. “Tim. Can you hear me.”

Tim frowns, eyebrows furrowing slightly. 

“Tim,” the voice insists. 

And Tim tries, he really does, shifts as much as he can, drags his eyelids open just a crack. He can barely see anything through his eyelashes. It’s bright. Way too bright. Tim groans. What’s going on?

A hand is back, on his forehead this time, so cool, and a soft keening noise comes out of Tim’s throat that he didn’t know he could even make. The hand moves through his hair, rests knuckles behind his ear for a moment, and somehow Tim feels like crying. 

“Yeah, I’ve got him,” Tim hears distantly. It sounds like the other voice is on the opposite side of wall of rushing water. “...was right to...sick. I’m worried he...dehydrated. Yeah. Yeah, I’m bringing...moment. Can...get the...guest room ready? Thanks.” 

Tim is drifting again. He’s really tired. _That hand was nice,_ he thinks. _It won’t mind if he sleeps for a while. Right?_ He's drifting again, possibly for moments, possibly for hours. It doesn't matter to him either way.

“Tim, buddy,” It’s the voice again. And the hand! The hand is back. Tim perks up, twists his head with what little energy he can, nestling further into the touch. “Hi,” says the voice. “You with me now?”

Tim hums. It’s too hard to open his eyes.

“I’m taking you home with me.” And wait. _Stranger danger,_ Tim thinks. _Street smarts!_ _You ain’t taking me to no secondary location, mister!_ Isn’t he supposed to...not go with people? But he’s not really scared this time. He’s too tired. And the voice is familiar, anyway, even if he can’t quite place it. The blessed hand smooths over his forehead again, twice. “It’s going to be okay.”

_Okay,_ Tim thinks. _If the hand stays, I trust you, I guess._ 

The hand, unfortunately, disappears as if it can hear Tim’s thoughts. He huffs, displeased. But then it’s _back_ , sliding under his shoulders and holding on tight, and another slips behind his knees, bunching up his flannel pajamas, and Tim’s heart swoops through the air as he’s lifted like a baby. The arms pull him tight up against a hard chest, stable, gentle. Tim curls into the chest. Relaxes a little more. He’s definitely not going to be dropped, not with this kind of strength. 

“I’ve got you,” the voice says, deep and soft, and Tim thinks _I don’t mind this too much after all._ It’s new, but good. For the first time in a long, long time, Tim feels like maybe it’s safe to let go. Just a little bit. Just till he feels a little better.

And then he’s asleep, wrapped up in strong arms and a promise and the warmth of a fever that he knows is going to be okay. 

* * *

The next time Tim is actually marginally aware of his own existence, he’s on something soft, wrapped up in warmth, and his head is smashed down into a stupidly puffy pillow. He never sleeps on pillows that soft. Clearly, he’s not in his own bed, which means he’s not in his room, which means...he has no idea what that means, _okay_, sue him, he’s sick. 

Tim drags his eyes open, which is a bit easier than earlier, or what he assumes was earlier. He doesn’t feel _quite_ as much like a limp pile of goo now. Still cold, though, which Tim takes as confirmation he probably still has a fever. He feels gross, both inside and out.

“Timothy?” A figure drifts into his narrow field of vision from off to the side, and he knows that voice. Alfred. 

“Mr. Pennyworth?” Tim’s voice is hardly clear enough to be called a rasp. 

“Just a moment,” Alfred says, and then a straw is between Tim’s lips and he’s taking a few sips of the best water he’s ever tasted in his life. So cool. So smooth. It’s perfect. God's choirs of angels should sing hymns about this water. And wait, Alfred is speaking again, oops. 

“You were dehydrated, but we’re getting fluids in you now, and medicine. You’ll be all right,” murmurs Alfred, and he pulls the straw away after a few more moments, and Tim wants so badly to ask what’s going on, why Alfred is here, where Tim even is, but he’s already drifting off again, already spent from that small effort. He's too tired to even dream.

* * *

Tim feels about 60% more human the next time he wakes up, and figures his fever must have gone down. The sweat-soaked sheets he’s on seem to confirm this theory, and he shifts around, a little uncomfortable. 

“Tim?” And oh. Oh no, that’s—

_“Tim!_ God. Don’t ever do this to us _again_. My poor heart can’t take it.” Tim ignores Jason’s theatrics for a moment to open his eyes and confirm that yes, that first voice was indeed Bruce Wayne himself, who for some reason is _sitting at Tim’s bedside_. In an unfamiliar room, too. _Must be Wayne Manor,_ Tim thinks, and maybe he should be upset that he’s not at home right now, but mostly all he feels is _tired_. There’ll be plenty of time for emotions later.

“Hi,” Tim says, and his voice is better than before. He’s still surprised at how much energy just speaking seems to take out of him at the moment.

“Hi yourself,” says Bruce. “You back with us now?”

“Uh. I think so.”

“Tim, Where’s Mrs. Mac?”

Tim coughs a few times, closing his eyes. It should be illegal for _eyelids_ to be sore. That’s just not fair. “She comes on Wednesdays and Saturdays. S’posed to call her if I need her other times.”

“Why didn’t you call her?” Bruce asks, and surprisingly there’s no tone of judgement Tim can discern. Just a genuine question. 

“I didn’t...it was really fast,” sighs Tim. He opens his eyes again, and Bruce and Jason are watching attentively. “I didn’t feel sick earlier. It hit me in like, an hour. I didn’t mean to fall asleep on the floor, I was going to call after I got some water.”

“Tim, buddy, I think you passed out more than fell asleep,” Bruce says, gently. “When I brought you over here, your fever was at 103.8.”

“What?” Tim says. Then, belatedly, “Why'd you come over?”

“You didn’t show up at school this morning,” Jason interjects. “Figured maybe you were just late, but when you weren’t anywhere by lunchtime and the no one in the school office had gotten any calls about you not being able to make it today, I panicked and called Alfred. Then he sent Bruce over, since Bruce was home today, and then B totally panicked when there was no answer at your house and broke in, and it’s a good thing he did since you were unresponsive on the floor, kid. You can’t keep going like this.”

“Jason,” says Bruce, and there’s a little bit of warning in his voice. “There’s time for that conversation later, when Tim is feeling better.”

“Fine,” Jason sighs. “But seriously, Tim, you should’ve been awake to see it, B was _worried_ .”

“You weren’t even here,” Bruce objects. “How would you know what I was like?” 

“Alfred was, and Alfie tells me everything over tea.” Jason sounds smug.

Tim laughs, regretting it a little when it sets off his still-sore throat. Bruce helps him sit up through the coughing jag, and then lays him down gently again afterward. 

“Sorry,” Tim wheezes. 

“You’ve got nothing to apologize for,” Bruce says. He leans forward, hands clasped between his knees, and makes sure he’s got Tim’s full attention before he speaks. “Okay, here are the facts. You’re sick with a very bad flu. We’ve got you on an IV for fluids because you were dehydrated, and also on IV fever reducer. We’ll switch you to a pill for that in a few hours. You’re going to stay here until you’re recovered, at least, because there’s no way we can in good conscience let you go back to an empty house while sick alone. You’re going to rest, and eat what Alfred gives you, and you’re not any kind of imposition on us. Understand? We’re very glad to have you here.”

“Okay,” Tim mumbles. “Still sorry.”

“Dumbass,” says Jason, fondly, and Bruce whacks him softly in the back of the head with a notebook. 

Tim grins tiredly. 

“Go on back to sleep,” says Bruce. “We’ve got this. Just rest up and feel better. We’ll wake you when it's time to eat or drink.”

“Okay,” Tim says again, and if Batman and Robin want him to trust them, the least he can do is give them that. He has time enough to feel guilty for taking their time up later, when he’s not feeling vaguely like roadkill and baked clam. 

It’s nice not being alone, this time.
