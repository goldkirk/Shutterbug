# you don't have to have it all together now (to have it all)

> Healing takes time. Tim's working on it. Also, shenanigans and brotherly fun!

#### Notes:

ONE MORE DAY and then I can finally sleep and have 10 days off work, I'm so excited. I'm considering making this into a series where I can do more fics and oneshots. If any of you have suggestions I'm all ears!

The final chapter MIGHT not be up tomorrow, if I end up crashing too early or stuck at the hospital late into the evening. But it'll be up by the end of this weekend no matter what! I'm so excited. 

Chapter title is from "All Together Now" by The Likes of Us.

* * *

There’s a clatter from the hallway. Tim shoots upright from a deep sleep as his bedroom door is slammed open straight into the neighboring wall. 

“That was _YOU?!”_ Jason practically shrieks, backlit in the doorway like an angel of righteous fury. His Wonder Woman pajamas are more rumpled than usual. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” says Tim, who is desperately clinging to the edge of his sheets in an attempt to not slip off the bed. _“What_ was me?”

“What is going on here?” Bruce asks, looming behind Jason in a hastily-thrown-on robe. The end of his sentence trails into a yawn so wide his jaw pops. 

_“BatWatch!”_ Jason’s voice is now at least an octave higher than Tim’s ever heard it before, and _oh god. What did I do now,_ Tim wonders, frantically flying through files and files of memories and nights and posts, looking for anything that Jason could possibly be mad about. 

“Yes,” Bruce says, with shocking patience for a man who has just been woken up at—Tim checks the clock— _3:17 in the morning._ “We have established that Tim is behind BatWatch. And knows who we are. And we’ve discussed this several times already, at times much more appropriate than the early morning. Go back to sleep.” 

“No!” Jason snaps, rounding on Bruce. His finger flies out to point in Tim’s direction. “The night with Scarecrow by the harbor. Didn’t Commissioner Gordon just mention that the kid we fished out of the harbor was BatWatch, not a hired teenager looking for quick money?” He turns back to Tim. “That was _Tim_, that night. In the harbor. Alone.” 

Bruce has gone white as the moonlight reflecting on the window. 

“Tim, is that correct?” Bruce asks, so, so carefully. 

“Uh,” Tim says. His fists tighten around the duvet. “Yeah. I was distracting Scarecrow, for a sec? So you’d have time to get there?” He shrugs, sheepish. “I got lost.” 

Bruce looks like he’s been shot. 

Jason opens and shuts his mouth a few times as his shoulders start to visibly shake. 

“You almost _died,”_ he bites out. 

“But you were there,” Tim points out. “You found me in time.” 

_“Timothy Jackson Drake,”_ Jason shouts in frustration, his voice deeply cracking for the first time in months. 

Tim throws himself backwards off the other side of his bed, hits the floor in a tangle of sheets and frozen breathing. He frees himself as quickly as he can. He faintly notices he’s fallen into the fighting stance that Bruce has been slowly teaching him in an effort to keep him safer while running around Gotham.

_“What?”_ Tim snaps back, and Bruce takes a step forward now, reaching for Jason’s shoulder. He’s promptly shrugged off. 

“Do you not care that you almost _died?”_ Jason asks, voice like a snapping fire. 

“I care plenty!” Tim fires back. “I just don’t see the point of dredging up the past when it already happened and I came out fine!”

“Fine? You had hypothermia!” 

“Which was _easily fixed!”_ 

“You could have gotten pneumonia! You could have _drowned!_ I could have not heard the splash because I was distracted by the fight!” Jason shouts back. “What would you have done then, Tim?” 

_“Died,_ I guess! Is that what you want to hear, Jason? I get it, okay! It was stupid. I was an idiot. By all rights I should have died, yeah.” Tim snarls. He feels like a venomous snake, spitting poison. “At least I would cause a lot fewer problems that way, if I had!” 

Tim’s voice is so loud. 

He realizes suddenly that he’s shaking, hot; it feels like his whole body is a live wire. Every inch of his skin feels filled with boiling blood, and the hair on the back of his neck is damp with sweat. Somehow, that’s what bothers him the most. 

Jason looks like Tim just struck him across the face. 

“I’m sorry,” Tim gasps. He drops down like a puppet with a cut string, balanced over his ankles, arms wrapped around his rib cage. He’s folded nearly in half, arms smashing into his thighs. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Jason, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” 

There are tears leaking from his eyes. It feels like they’re burning his cheeks everywhere they touch. 

Everything is too _much_. 

He can hear Jason sniffing on the other side of the room, and his own heartbeat, and the fan going over in the corner, _so loud._ Hears the air whistling in his throat as he sucks it in, wheezes it out, never enough. Like he’s drowning all over again, in lava instead of ice. 

Tim blinks, blinks again, and suddenly Bruce is in front of him, broad and steady and frowning, and Tim—_he’s sorry, he’s sorry, he’s so so sorry, he’ll do better next time, he’s sorry._

Bruce is making soft shushing noises, carefully unwinding the sheets from around Tim’s feet, setting the fabric up on the bed. Jason is gone.

Jason is gone.

_“Jason,”_ Tim gasps, and he’s scrambling, clawing for the door in his mad dash, but Bruce catches him solidly around the waist as Tim attempts to throw his entire body weight across the room. 

“Tim, _listen to me,_ listen, _shhhh_,” Bruce soothes. He’s got one arm around Tim’s torso and upper arms, his legs wrapped around Tim’s, carefully holding them down, free hand rhythmically stroking through Tim’s hair, and hey, _when did they sit down on the ground?_ “Tim. Jason is fine. He’s got Ace, Alfred is with him. Do you remember them leaving?”

Tim shakes his head violently. Why doesn’t he remember? How did they end up on the floor? 

“Okay. That’s okay, Tim, it’s fine,” Bruce murmurs. “Can you tell me what you’re thinking right now?”

Tim shakes his head even as he’s already speaking. “Jason hates me,” he whispers.

“Jason most definitely does _not_ hate you,” Bruce says firmly. Then, softer: “Why do you think that, Tim?”

“I was awful,” Tim gasps. “I said a horrible thing. I shouldn’t have said that. He’s going to hate me now. I hurt him.”

“You were not awful,” Bruce chides. “You’re not an awful person. You’re a very good person. Even good people say things they regret sometimes, things that hurt others. And Jason loves you very, very much, Tim. Something like this isn’t going to change that.”

“No,” says Tim, but Bruce doesn’t listen. 

“You are good,” Bruce says into his ear, holding him tighter. “You’re really upset, right now, and you’re not thinking clearly. Jason, too. Both of you weren’t thinking straight a few minutes ago. But everything is going to be all right. You just had a little argument. You and Jason will apologize to each other, hug it out, and make things okay again. I promise Jason is not going to hate you for this.”

“What’s wrong with me,” Tim says, miserably. He can’t stop the monotone from taking over his voice.

“I think you were a little bit triggered, buddy,” Bruce says gently. “How are you feeling right now?”

“Hot.”

“Mm. Do you feel up to finding Jason and Ace? Jason should be all settled down by now. He’s used to dealing with this.”

Tim doesn’t know. He wants to hug Jason. He never wants to see him again. He wants to snuggle up on the couch and he wants to run to the opposite side of the house, far far away. He doesn’t want Jason to ever yell that at him again. 

“My name,” Tim says, realization dawning. “Jason yelled my name.”

Bruce’s hand pauses in Tim’s hair for a moment. “That’s what made it get bad?”

“I guess.”

“You were stressed before that, too, though. Ever since Jason startled you by barging in. I saw, but I didn’t stop things, and I should have.” Bruce sighs. “I’m sorry Tim, that one’s on me. I _know_ both of you, and next time I won’t hesitate to step in and keep things from escalating, all right?”

Tim nods. It’s not Bruce’s fault, but words are really hard right now, and Tim can’t find the energy to say that out loud.

“How about we go find Jason now, huh?” Bruce says, slowly unwrapping himself from Tim and helping him to his feet. Tim’s still shaky, and waiting for the hammer to fall. But it’s not quite as bad as it was. 

“Okay,” says Tim, and they head out, hand in hand. 

“I’m sorry for yelling at you, and pushing it,” Jason says, inches away from Tim’s head. They’re both being squashed, under a very happy, very snuggly Ace. Bruce is watching over them from the couch after having tucked a blanket over them and taken the tray of late-night tea from Alfred to hold till the boys were ready.

“It’s fine,” Tim says. 

“It’s not, really.” Jason’s smile is bitter around the edges. “I’m supposed to have better control than that.”

“Everyone has bad days,” Bruce pipes up from the couch. “You’re not a robot, Jason. Cut yourself a little slack.”

“Okay, _Dad,”_ Jason drawls.

Tim can just see the slight upturn of Bruce’s lips as he flips a book page. 

“Anyway,” Jason goes on. “I won’t do that again. I’m just...really bad when people are reckless with their lives. I’ll tell you about it sometime, but...not right now.” He looks at Ace’s big eyes, scratches a soft furry ear. “Too close.”

“I’m really sorry too,” Tim says. “I shouldn’t have yelled or said any of that. I don’t know why I said it at all.”

“You were running on autopilot,” Jason sighs. “It happens. I get it. But Tim, dude, some part of you meant it. Just so you know.”

“No,” Tim insists. 

“Yes,” says Jason. “And I’ll bet you a million bucks that Bruce has already filed that information away in his ginormous brain so that he can make sure Dinah talks with you about it sometime.”

“Do you even _have_ a million bucks?” Tim laughs. More quietly than usual, but still. A laugh is a laugh. “And who’s Dinah?”

“Black Canary,” Jason says. He points to himself with a grin. “And I have it on good authority that I’m now a trust fund baby, so who knows? I bet I’m filthy rich. Rumor has it that my dad is _loaded_.”

Bruce snorts from the couch at the same time that Tim laughs into Ace’s fur. 

It’s a bad night. But he’s not alone. Tomorrow doesn’t have to be a bad day, too. 

Tim and Jason fall asleep side by side on the floor under Bruce’s watchful eye, and don’t wake up again till Dick comes home for the weekend and throws donuts right onto their noses, like some twisted game of horseshoes. Tim and Jason stuff their faces with sprinkle donuts while chasing Dick down into the cave and around the gymnastics equipment clamoring for payback. 

Tim is never going to get over how wild it is to have _brothers_.

* * *

Betting behind Batman’s back is apparently a Thing this year.

Tim is perched on a low-hanging gargoyle when he snaps a shot of Robin (disgruntled, resigned) passing Nightwing (quite smug. Irritatingly smug, in fact) some bills as they stand side by side watching Batman take down Killer Croc on what is only the second weirdest Easter morning of Tim’s life. 

“Boys!” Batman growls. “A little help, perhaps?”

“Nah,” Nightwing calls back cheerfully. “Looks like you’re doing fine over there!”

“I’m gonna make you do the Fitnessgram for a week,” Bruce snarls, somehow finding new depths of upper body strength just in time to wrestle Croc to the pavement and gain the upper hand.

Tim and Jason shudder on opposite sides of the street.

“I’m a grown up, B, you can’t make me do _anything!”_

“I’ll take away all your cereal from the house,” Bruce threatens. Croc roars, and Batman tiredly yanks a muzzle up around his jaw. “No more.”

“No! I’ll do the Fitnessgram, I promise. I take it back, okay, I’m sorry.”

“Too late.” Batman shakes his head, but he’s smiling. “You snooze, you lose, chum. You had your chance, and you decided to sass me instead.”

Nightwing looks so devastated, Tim can’t help shaking with silent laughter as he snaps the blackmail photo. 

_“My Cap’n Crunch,”_ Nightwing whispers, sadly. Robin pats his shoulder a few times before strolling away towards the next dark alley. 

“Hard luck, Wingdings,” he calls back over his shoulder. “Although...if you want access to my stash, we could always try to work out some kind of deal that would be...mutually beneficial.” And Robin knows he’s got his big brother, then, hook, line, and sinker.

Nightwing turns and follows, grumbling all the way.

Three nights later, Robin and Nightwing both stick around on the GCPD precinct roof for an extra minute once Batman has vanished. 

“Pay up, squirts,” Gordon says, rubbing his fingers together. 

They pay up. Gordon grins. 

“Better luck next time,” he says. Whistles a few bars of an old song. “This is why you don’t bet against your elders.”

He pretends to miss the middle finger Robin throws up as the two vigilantes take their usual running leaps off into the dark Gotham night.

“I want in,” Tim says earnestly. He steps out from behind the air conditioner. “On your side.”

“You want to bet against your brothers?” Gordon raises an eyebrow. 

“I want to make the safest financial investment in an uncertain market,” Tim says primly. “So. Yeah. Basically.”

Gordon considers him for a moment. 

“Deal.” 

They shake on it. 

Two weeks later, Tim and Gordon are three hundred bucks richer apiece. Nightwing and Robin are scheming for revenge. Batman still doesn’t have a clue about any of it.

“What are you planning to do with the money, kid?” Gordon asks.

“I’ve got a few ideas.” Tim waves a hand vaguely. 

“Care to share with the class?”

“No,” says Tim, and he drops over the roof edge without so much as a goodbye. 

Gordon sighs, scrubbing at the furrow between his brows. “Kid’s getting more like a Bat every day,” he grumbles to the empty roof, then heads back inside.

And on the balcony below, safely out of sight, Tim grins. 

* * *

Tim’s first session with Black Canary, once they get all the “He’s not a vigilante. Yet. But he is family,” business sorted, isn’t great.

The second one as a little better. They’re going to just play things by ear for now.

“Is it really normal to feel so wrecked after a session?” Tim asks Jason quietly while they share some sandwiches Alfred packed in Tim’s backpack for that night’s patrol. Jason kicks his legs as they dangle off the edge of the bank’s roof. 

“Can be,” he says, around a mouthful of PB&J. “They were like that for me in the beginning, but then it got better. It’s hard to work through stuff.”

“You’re telling me,” Tim groans. _Is it truly necessary to process trauma?_ he wonders. _Is it not enough for me to just pack it up in boxes and never look at it again, until one day, I die?_

“But listen,” Jason says. “You’re doing _fine_. There’s no wrong way to go to therapy. And I promise, it really does keep getting easier. You’ll have ups and downs, but BC and you’ll find a rhythm that works for you, specifically. If you’re overwhelmed, _speak up and tell her._ She’ll dial it down until you’re ready to go hard again.”

“Okay,” Tim says, and he means it.

He’s getting better at that—actually speaking up when he needs or just wants something. It’s still only maybe two times out of ten that he’ll do it, but hey. Progress is progress. The first time he asked Bruce if they could maybe get some McDonald’s ice cream on the way home from a gala the other week, he thought Bruce was going to cry.

The four of them all got banana splits from a fancy creamery, which was, like. Massive overkill. But Tim appreciates it anyway.

* * *

“Boys,” Bruce says, stepping into the lounge with coffee firmly in hand. “Can you settle down for three consecutive seconds?”

Jason casually pokes Tim’s side while the younger boy is in midair, causing him to crumple inward and land in an awkward heap with a loud _oof._

“I dunno, B,” Jason says, innocently. _“I’m_ being perfectly quiet over here just waiting my turn.” He jerks a thumb over in the direction of Dick, who’s currently perched on a light fixture that should in no way be supporting his weight right now. “Take it up with Golden Boy over there if you’ve got a problem. He’s the one who suggested the backflip contest.”

“Did not!” And Dick sticks out his tongue. “You’re the one who wanted to have a contest. I just wanted to show off my mad skills.”

“Yeah, which we’ve seen a billion times already.”

“It’s my fault,” Tim says, from where he’s picking himself up off the floor. 

“No it’s not,” Dick and Jason chorus in unison. 

“Okay, it’s not,” Tim amends. “But I _did_ say I was bored. Which kind of started the whole mess.” He frowns. “Also, Jason owes me a Crunch bar. I totally would have beat him on that last pass. My angular momentum was better.”

Bruce drops into an armchair. “I am surrounded by children,” he moans.

“And whose fault is that, I wonder?” Alfred says pointedly as he steps over the threshold. 

Dick grins and double-flips down off of his perch. “Perfectly dramatic entrance as always, Alfie.”

“I do try.”

_“Children,”_ Bruce groans. As if anyone is still taking him seriously by now. 

“Um,” Tim starts. “Did you need something, Bruce?”

“Actually, yes,” Bruce says. And now everyone settles down. Of course, Tim thinks. They’re all too well trained by Batman Obedience Lessons and unofficial Robin’s-Guide-to-the-Care-and-Keeping-(and-Reading-the-Cues)-of-Batman to not at least halfheartedly snap to attention when Bruce Has Something to Say.

“Tim,” Bruce says. _Oh golly._ “The judge wants to interview you.”

It feels like the air been kicked right out of Tim’s chest. 

“I told her tomorrow would be fine,” Bruce says, carefully. “I figured you’d want to get it over with as soon as possible so there would be less time to worry. Is that all right? We can reschedule, if you want to wait.”

“Yeah, it’s fine,” Tim says automatically. Bruce frowns softly.

“Tim,” he says, walking over. He takes Tim’s face in his hands, makes solid eye contact. “Is it _actually_ all right? Check in with yourself.”

Oh. Right.

Tim thinks for a few moments. Thinks about how his brain is already churning, already _dreading_ . He’d love to put this off for a while longer (or forever. Forever would be great), stick his head under the covers and never deal with it. Not be responsible for his part in this process of ruining his parents’ lives and reputation. 

But he also wants to just rip off the bandaid and not have the interview hanging over his head. He’s got enough to deal with as it is. And…

“Can you come with me?” Tim asks, quietly. 

“Of course,” Bruce says. “I can’t go in the room with you, but I’ll walk there and back with you every step of the way.” 

And, wow, doesn’t that make Tim want to cry for a hot second? When has he ever had _that_ before?

Tim chews on his lip. “I’d...like to do it tomorrow, I think. You’re right. I want to get it over with.”

“Okay,” says Bruce, with a small smile, warm and real and promising _I’ve got your back, buddy, always._ “Then we leave at ten tomorrow.”

“At ten,” Tim echoes. 

It feels like he’s walking to his execution, stepping off a high dive, and opening a window to fresh spring air after a long winter all at once. 

* * *

Tim and the judge talk a lot longer and more openly than Tim had been expecting. _I think I got a good one,_ he marvels. She’s middle aged. Quick and witty. A little snappy, a lot humorous, and sharp on the uptake. He likes her a lot.

They talk about his interactions with his parents. His time at home. How he took care of himself, what he had help for. They talk about what his parents want for him, and how Tim has felt living with the Waynes for the better part of several months now. They talk about Ace, and Tim’s nature photography, and Bruce taking Tim out for Thai food when he aced his math test.

“How do you feel about your parents, Tim?” she asks him towards the end. 

Tim shrugs, a little helplessly. “I love them,” he says. 

“And?” she prompts.

“And what?”

_“And,”_ she says, leaning across her desk a bit. “What else do you feel about them? I know there’s more than just that. Everyone feels more than just that for their family. You can love family to pieces and still have them drive you around the bend sometimes. Lord knows _I_ do.”

“I…” Tim hesitates. His gaze skitters over to the window, the file drawers, a plant.

“Nothing you say here will ever leave this room or be mentioned to anyone else,” she reminds him gently. “You’re safe to say what you want.”

Tim takes a few deep breaths, counting the way Dinah taught him. He forces himself to stop twisting his hoodie strings around and around and _around_ . 

“I love them,” he says again. “And I’m afraid of them. I—I love them so much, you know? They’re my mom and dad. Mine. They go all over the world doing these amazing things, and helping tons of people, and I get to see the difference they make in the world. And they’re so smart, and talented. Mom’s really good at baking. And Dad taught me about birds a lot, when they were going on trips to jungles. And he taught me how to change a tire, and helped me with my homework, and took me to the Knights game once. And Mom patched me up and sang to me when I had a bad fall off my bike on the gravel. I love them.” 

Tim flips the hood of his hoodie up, one hand squeezing the fabric tight underneath his chin. He pulls his knees up to his chest, glances back up at the judge. Her expression has not wavered. She’s still open, attentive, just calmly listening. 

Tim swallows. “I feel like I’m betraying them,” he says quietly.

“I only need you to tell me your truth,” she says, matching his tone.

And. 

Well. Isn’t that a funny way to put it? _My truth,_ Tim thinks. He’s twisting the hoodie strings into knot after loop after knot. _There’s always just been the truth, right? Something IS the way it is, regardless of what I feel. If my parents are right, I’m wrong. If something bothers me that they did or said, that’s my problem for taking it wrong or too hard. That’s how it is._

Except...if it isn’t. 

_When Jason is upset or hurt because of something,_ Tim muses, _Bruce doesn’t tell him he’s taking it wrong, or being too sensitive. He just...listens. He accepts whatever Jason is feeling and helps him work it out. Like, that’s Jason’s true feeling about it, regardless of if Bruce or I or someone else thinks the same way about the situation. Even if it’s something I could have been fine with and not batted an eyelash, Bruce doesn’t say that Jason just shouldn’t be stressed about it. He’s like “yeah, okay, let’s see what we can do to make this better.” Jason’s allowed to experience what he experiences. Even if it involves him feeling hurt by something Bruce says or does._ So...Tim guesses he is, too. No matter what his parents have taught him in the past.

“They hurt me,” Tim says, a little louder now. “I didn’t realize how much they were hurting me before. They keep _leaving,”_ and he wishes his voice wouldn’t keep cracking at the stupidest times. “I feel really bad for dragging them into this mess when they didn’t even do anything really bad,” he says. “But...every time I think about going back home, I just get so tired. I know they’ll be really mad, and I’ll be miserable while they are, and then they’re just going to leave again anyway no matter what they say. Because I’m not worth staying for.”

“Honey,” the judge says then. “You listen real closely, because I’m only going to say this once, and I want you to remember it.”

“Okay.” Tim sits up, focuses. 

“Love, real love, healthy love? Is not _draining_ . It doesn’t leave you feeling tired. Love isn’t supposed to make you miserable, kiddo. I know your parents aren’t bad people. They clearly do a lot of good for the world, from everything I’ve heard. But that doesn’t mean they’re good for _you_ . If you’ve been hurt, you’ve been hurt. You don’t need to make apologies or explain it away because it’s done by people you love and want to protect, okay? You remember that as you keep going through life.”

“Yes ma’am,” Tim says, quietly. 

“Okay,” she says. “I think that’s everything I needed to hear, unless you’ve got anything you want to add.”

Tim shakes his head. 

“Then scram, honey,” and she smiles at him. “You’ve got a nervous guardian waiting out there who I bet wants to give you a pretty big hug.”

And Bruce really, really does. They don’t leave the courthouse for a solid ten minutes. Tim is happy to just let Bruce take over for a while while he hides away in the depths of Bruce’s warm chest and thick sweater folds. 

“I got you, buddy,” Bruce tells him, after a minute. 

Tim smiles into the ribbed knitting. Alfred’s careful handiwork. “I know, B. I trust you.”

Bruce squeezes just a little bit tighter. 

* * *

At the end of all the long, drawn-out fighting (and lawyer back-and-forths and court appearances and Strongly Worded Emails), the verdict comes down in early May while Tim is at school. Jason is sent by the office to come pull Tim out of a lecture on how the Prohibition led to the rise of organized crime in America, and when Tim sends him a questioning glance as Jason drags him by the arm down the hall, stone-faced and brooding, Jason just says, “Judge decided.”

Tim gulps. There’s only one thing that a judge was involved in that had anything to do with Tim right now. He’s suddenly not sure he wants to know.

They reach the office to find Bruce there, already waiting in front of the reception desk. Tim has, by now, worked himself into a mild panic. 

“Bruce,” he says, stopping just inside the threshold. Jason is looking at him with a little bit of concern. 

“Hey, Tim,” Bruce says. He sounds solemn. _Oh, god. No._

“Bruce,” Tim says, desperately. “I—um. It’s okay. I know you tried really hard, I appreciate everything so much, it’s okay, really, I’ll be okay, it’s—it’s—it’s fine, they’ll be better this time around. And I know more, and I’m not alone anymore the way I used to be, so—” Tim realizes he’s started to leak a few tears. Bruce looks stricken. 

“Oh, no,” Bruce says, striding across the small gap to kneel in front of Tim and take his shoulders in a firm grip. “Tim, baby, no, I’m so sorry. I should have realized you’d think the worst. It’s okay.”

“What,” Tim croaks.

Jason comes over and wraps Tim up from behind. “It’s okay, baby bird,” he says. “Scout’s honor.”

“You’ve never been a Boy Scout a day in your life,” Bruce says fondly. 

“What,” Tim says again. Because it sounds like they were trying, in a really stupid, roundabout way, to say—

“The judge ruled in our favor,” Bruce says, finally, the corners of his eyes crinkling up in a big, real smile. “Long term placement under my care, buddy. You’re not going anywhere.”

“You’re stuck with us now!” Jason crows, as if Tim had ever wanted anything different.

Tim stares.

“You don’t ever have to live with your parents again, Tim. You get to stay." 

And now Tim is bursting into tears, burrowing into Bruce's shoulder, and laughing through his hiccups at the same time. Bruce and Jason and Tim are all tangled up on the floor of the school office, laughing and crying together, and Tim can't believe how lucky he is. It's finally starting to be over, one piece at a time. And this is a particularly big one.

"Welcome home, Tim," Bruce whispers. "Welcome to the family. Although this is really just a formality. You’re already on the Christmas card." And they're all off and laughing all over again, as if they're never going to stop.
