So! 

_So_. 

Tim may have not thought this whole living situation through as well as he should have. (Not that he had much of a choice in the matter, really—Bruce Wayne tended to get his way in the end in most situations. But still.) This whole thing? The living-with-Batman-and-Robin-under-their-roof thing? The Batman’s-paranoia-and-security-measures-are-extreme thing? A lot more complicated than Tim had anticipated.

Like, he knew Batman was paranoid and very, _very_ good at his job. But Tim hadn’t _realized_, had no true hint of the scope, no way to possibly understand what that meant in practice, in real life, outside of the city at night. 

He sure has a good idea _now_. 

Trying to figure out Batman’s security measures is a goddamn _nightmare_. Tim knows he has no hope of predicting all of them, so he spends a lot of his free time just...poking around. Exploring. Innocently enough, always. It’s completely reasonable for a newcomer to get lost in an unfamiliar setting as large as Wayne Manor. 

He finds layer upon layer of security. Everywhere. Alarmed windows, hidden cameras, unhidden cameras, panic buttons galore. Jason, bless him, gives Tim a hushed heads-up that pretty much all areas of the roof have motion sensors, so if he’s planning to sneak out for a smoke or anything, he’s gotta make sure to deactivate the nearby ones for the duration if he doesn’t want an extremely panicked Bruce crashing through the roof access stairwell thinking someone’s trying to break in. 

Tim thanks him for the fair warning, and watches attentively as Jason demonstrates how to get around the security. In return, he shows Jason his camera and a few of his better wide angle shots of Gotham and Vernon State Park vistas, a carefully calculated risk. Tells Jason that he likes nature photography, and has been trying to take night sky photos from the roof of his house for a while now, so _thanks, Jason, he’s probably going to end up using the info soon, yeah, really appreciate it. Please don’t tell anyone, though, please, it’s embarrassing, he doesn’t like people knowing about his photos._

“It’s not embarrassing!” Jason says, hotly, and Tim is a little awed at how quickly Jason is offended on his behalf. “Photography is a completely respectable hobby to have, and from what I can see so far you’re great at it. Anyone who’s told you otherwise is a half-cooked brussels sprout.” 

Tim snorts. 

“I just…” He pauses. 

Does he play up the pity angle? He knows Jason is weak for it. Tim hates himself more than a little for how clearly he always reads people and knows how to manipulate them. He reads moods and watches micro expressions, engages in a delicate tango of interactions with the grace of a bomb defuser, and he always, _always_ knows how to make people feel sympathy for him. He hates the manipulation, but it’s gotten him out of so many binds over the years he can’t bring himself to properly stop. But is now the right time?

He doesn’t _want_ to manipulate Jason. Never. Jason is all fire and warmth and an enormous good heart under the rough and tumble attitude he holds up against the world like a suit of armor. Tim doesn’t want to use that against him. But the risk of being found out by Batman is so high, and Tim can’t just stop his work for months on end—people depend on BatWatch. Value it. And besides, it’s just about the only good thing Tim’s accomplished so far in life, his one real success, even if it’s secret no one else knows. He just...he _has_ to.

“I just don’t want any adults to know right now, okay. I don’t want a repeat of my parents getting annoyed about it,” Tim finally says, because that is, _technically,_ true. “It’s important to me. I need to protect what little self-confidence I still have about it.” And that was a little bit _too_ truthful, so Tim tries to laugh it off, downplay his slip. 

Jason’s not laughing.

_O fuck,_ Tim thinks desperately. _Now you’ve done it. You made Jason get the “worried about you, but trying to hide it because I know attacking the issue head-on scares people off, but it’s not working properly because I’m physically incapable of hiding my worry, unlike my more skilled mentor Batman who has a Stone Face Mode to rival Mount Rushmore” expression,_ and boy oh boy Tim is in for it now. Jason’s got his face screwed up, trying so hard to let the issue go like Tim wants, but Tim _knows_ he’s going to fail miserably in about three, two—

“Is _that_ what happened with your parents?” Jason asks, question exploding out in a rush. 

Huh. Didn’t make it to zero. Tim might need to adjust his internal Robin countdown timer, then, unless this turns out to be an isolated incident. _Need more data,_ Tim thinks, and absently puts a pin in that thought to come back to at a less delicate time. 

Tim clams up. He can almost feel the shuttering that Jason much be watching play out across his face right now.

“Tim,” Jason says, one hand out, conciliatory. Nonthreatening. Like Tim is a small animal about to spook. Tim isn’t sure if he feels offended by that or not. 

“Jason,” Tim replies evenly.

“I thought you said they liked the photo books. Thought they were neat.” 

Jason sounds upset now, and _ugh_ , this is exactly why Tim didn’t and _didn’t want to talk about it_ . The past is the past, he shouldn’t have gotten his hopes up, parents don’t want to be bothered with photography, lesson learned! Time to move on. It happened, it’s over, it doesn’t matter. 

But now Jason’s going to be sad about it, and probably tell Dick, and make Dick sad, and both of them will be sad together at Tim, and Tim is allergic to people trying to pity him for no real reason, and _he needs to get out of here before it goes any further._

“Jason, it doesn’t matter. There are way more people in the world than my parents, I’m sure someone will have a use for those books. I already donated them to Goodwill. It’s fine.” Jason, contrary to what Tim had hoped, now looks stricken. 

“You—Tim!”

“I really have to go,” Tim blurts. “I’ve got...a thing. For history. Just remembered it’s due tomorrow. Thanks for showing me the roof, I appreciate it!” And he shoves through the rooftop access door before Jason can say another word. 

* * *

Nine days into BatWatch’s self-imposed _“Sorry for vanishing, I had a personal emergency for a few days and now I’m going to be out of town for a bit ‘til everything has been sorted out”_ hiatus, Tim is finally ready to hit the streets. He’s scoped out Wayne Manor inside and out, he’s extracted what information he can from Dick and Jason, he’s tweaked his disguise, and he’s figured out exactly which university wifi he’s going to use to update the blog that night. Because he definitely isn’t about to try using Wayne Manor’s network, which he’s positive is heavily monitored by both Bruce and Babs. Batman probably has an alert set to ping him if a BatWatch login was ever flagged in his home network packets

Tim isn’t about to give the whole game up that easily. It would be plain shameful, after all the hide and seek they’ve been doing for the past couple years.

So Tim is ready. Or as ready as he’s ever going to be, anyway, short of explicitly asking someone _hey, hi, yeah, how would one go about sneaking out of Wayne Manor completely undetected? Just asking for science._ 

He bids Alfred goodnight, throws a banana at Jason to remind him to eat before bed (patrol), waves at Bruce through the study’s open doorway, and purportedly turns in for the evening. Tim stays curled up under blankets long enough to listen for the Manor to grow more or less silent, and then throws the covers off and drags his backpack from under the bed. He gives it one last check. 

Ten minutes later, Tim is on the roof, headed for the gutters at the edge. He’s got a rope already anchored to an AC unit, which Bruce thankfully had the foresight to have anchored solidly down into the rooftop with steel bolts. Tim rappels carefully over the roof edge, just like he practiced, until he can grasp one of the large limbs on a particularly good climbing tree and scramble down. He uses the ridiculous amount of hedges to sneak his way over to the Drake property line. From there, he takes his usual path to the city.

It’s go time.

* * *

Tim’s been out for a few hours, getting good shots of Batman and Robin and trying to collect dirt on a drug ring that sprung up in the Dockland over the past few weeks. Normally, he wouldn’t be trying to get many shots of one of those—Batman tends to find them sooner rather than later and take care of the problem without outside help. But this one has been cutting weed and Molly with some really bad stuff, according to word on the street, and people are landing themselves in the hospital. A few unlucky souls even end up in the morgue. 

Cocaine. Opiates. Sometimes various cleaning agents. The cut drugs were circulating among a younger crowd, mostly teenagers. No grown ups so far. Which means this ring is likely targeting the nearby school, and spreading out from there. 

Tim doesn’t like people who pick on kids. And neither does Batman. At _all_ . 

He snaps a shot of two of the men tearing open a stuffed turtle. Pulling out a baggie. Running its contents through their fingers like sand. Tasting it, touching a white-coated finger to their tongue and laughing. Chucking the baggie back into a box like it’s not about to maybe ruin someone’s entire life the next day. He takes photos of the crates, zooms in on labels and numbers, hoping to capture something that will be helpful in identifying a pipeline. 

Tim’s just about finished for the night, ready to compile tonight’s post for BatWatch and then upload the evidence photos to the police dropbox, since Gordon will get the info to Batman within two days. They have a system between them, Gordon and Tim. Tim hacked Gordon’s email once upon a time and let him know he was BatWatch and he wanted to help. Gordon, to Tim’s delight, accepted. Few questions asked. (Working with Batman had probably desensitized the Commissioner’s wariness towards nameless vigilante types somewhat, by then.)

Tim sends evidence to GCPD on a regular basis, but he only flags certain data dumps with _“It was a dark night tonight, but I managed to catch—”_ and then ends the sentence with whatever the description is of his photos. Gordon knows those are for the Dark Knight of Gotham, and sets the wheels of fate in motion. Or so Tim likes to imagine.

So that’s the plan—post, evidence, crash in bed. But as Tim is preparing to pack up for the night, sudden motion a few shipping container rows over catches his eye. It’s too far away for him to make out clearly, but with his highest zoom lens he should be able to get a better look. He digs in his bag, carefully pulling out the wrapped and padded lens, slots it into the front of his camera. 

And there’s Scarecrow. Bold as you please. Standing right next to a shipping container. Speaking calmly with one of the drug lords. 

* * *

Oh, hell no. Shit, fuck, _and_ damn, this is bad. No, make that capital-b, trademark symbol _Bad__™_. 

Tim ducks around a rooftop water tower’s leg to think for a minute. 

Problem number one: Scarecrow is supposed to be in Arkham. If he’s out, there’s a possibility of other inmates being on the loose as well. Clearly Arkham isn’t aware of the problem, yet, because there’s been no push alert on Tim’s phone, and no sirens set off in the city. Which means aside from the criminals down below, Tim is likely the only person in the whole city who knows that Scarecrow is out and about. Which means Tim has got to do something about it, right? 

Problem number two: Tim has stopped tracking Batman and Robin for the night. He has no idea if they’re even in Gotham proper anymore. For all Tim knows, they’re off getting ice cream or dealing with a domestic dispute on the other side of the river. He also doesn’t have a way of contacting them. 

Problem three, and most pressing: Scarecrow deals in fear toxin. It’s his whole _thing_ . It’s his magnum opus, his crowning jewel. _He_ feels no fear, except when encountering Batman. And he’s addicted to that fear, wants to instill it in everyone else in the world. Scarecrow has tried multiple times over the years to poison Gotham—tainted candy, gas mains, water mains, aerosol balloons, fear-gas-filled party crackers on New Year’s Eve, and even an entire blimp one unhappily memorable summer. Scarecrow partnering with a drug ring is the _worst_ kind of news. And Tim knows better than most citizens how much can be accomplished overnight in Gotham; if they reach an agreement down there, hundreds of pounds of drugs could be ready for distribution to unsuspecting teenagers by morning, laced with potent fear toxin instead of just aspirin or whatever else they’d planned on using tonight. 

Tim has to _do something_ . This can’t be allowed to happen. He has no way of contacting Batman, short of hollering at the top of his lungs, which would be just plain stupid. That’s a surefire way to get shot and hunted down if he’s ever heard one. He can call the police, but there’s no way they’ll arrive before Scarecrow would get enough warning to lickety-split and vanish to some hidey hole of a sewer or wherever he chooses to hide this time. 

Tim groans quietly. He really, really doesn’t want to do this. 

He swings himself down onto the nearest fire escape anyway. 

* * *

“Hi,” Tim says, a little breathlessly, into his earpiece, the only thing he kept on him when he stashed his backpack on an unused rooftop. “Um, I’m by the shipping docks, and I want to report a Scarecrow sighting as of about ten minutes ago.”

The keys he could hear clicking on the other end of the line go silent. 

“Are you sure?” the dispatcher sounds distinctly less lively than when they first answered the phone. 

“Yeah, pretty sure,” Tim replies. “Since I can see him talking with another criminal right now.” He throws himself into a leap and handsprings off a ledge onto the building’s lower roof, takes off running to vault a narrow alleyway and lands on the roof of the next building over. Ancient gravel pieces crackle under his sneakers, and he skids. 

“Just a moment,” the dispatcher says, faintly, and there’s a click on the line.

“Hello?” And Comisioner Gordon is on the call. 

Huh. _That’s convenient,_ Tim thinks, then bites back a curse as he rolls his ankle while landing another jump. He may be a lot better than he used to be at freerunning (a _none success with left broken wrist_ video on YouTube, courtesy of Ives, was the highlight of his earliest attempts), but he’s no Robin. 

“Comissioner,” Tim says, quiet and confident. He’s perched on the closest rooftop to Scarecrow now. The two men are still discussing the deal. He can see the drug lord waving his hands in sweeping gestures, while Scarecrow leans in slightly, seeming thoroughly engaged. “I’m reporting Scarecrow loose in Gotham.”

“Where,” Gordon says, and this is why Tim loves him. No questioning, no nonsense, no dilly-dallying, no fear in his voice for criminals to pick up on. Just trust. Just action. Tim would bet a Doritos Locos taco that Gordon is already yanking on his coat and heading out of the office door to alert the precinct. 

“Shipping docks, northernmost area,” Tim says. “He’s talking with a drug lord.”

“Shit.” Gordon is quiet, but Tim picks up on it anyway. 

“Yeah,” he agrees. “The drug shipments are nearby, but I don’t know if your men will have time to tackle that and still catch Scarecrow. He’s in the process of making some kind of deal, and if it goes down the kids in the area high school are going to be landing in the hospital with a 100% success rate. I’d bet anything. They have the drugs hidden in stuffed turtles this time, for the record.”

“Who _are_ you?” Gordon demands, and Tim can hear the chaos of a precinct swirling into motion, the sound of car doors slamming. A car starting. “Get _out_ of there. It’s dangerous.”

Tim thinks hard. Gordon has no clue who he is, and Tim’s disguise is good enough that even if the police spot him, he could never be linked back to Timothy Drake by any facial recognition, human _or_ software based. His voice could be a weak spot, maybe, but Tim is using a completely different accent right now than his normal. And Gordon trusts who he _really_ is. 

“BatWatch,” he answers, finally.

“You kidding me?”

“No sir,” Tim hisses. “And I gotta go. Call Bats. Flick the signal. Scarecrow always wants _him_. He’ll stay for a showdown.”

_“Get out of there!”_ Gordon really means it. Tim feels bad for the genuine distress he can hear in the Commissioner’s voice.

“Sorry,” he says. “Good luck.” He ends the call. 

* * *

Tim picks his way down the stone corner pieces of the decrepit apartment building as quietly as he can, afraid that even looking at the rusty fire escape for a second too long might cause it to start creaking. There are police sirens faintly in the distance now, and Tim kind of wants to cry, or take a sledgehammer to some old cabinets and go to town. The police never seem to realize that if they give advance warning that they know something’s up, the criminals are going to have time to prepare or get away instead of being caught by surprise. But habits die hard, he guesses, even in a place as crazy as Gotham.

Scarecrow is going to bolt if Tim doesn’t do something _right now._ And it’s stupid. It’s awful, terrible, absolutely _batshit_ insane, Tim could get _seen_ , Tim could get gassed, Tim could get _shot_ . But he’s up and running across the last gap, scrambling quietly up the side of a shipping container stack. Just as the city’s warning sirens begin spinning to life, eerily echoing through the rows of containers, Tim throws with all his might, and a batarang embeds itself in the metal just inches away from Scarecrow’s shoulder. 

Scarecrow whips around, mask firmly in place, scanning the stacks for his enemy. 

_“Batman,”_ he hisses, and Tim has got to be careful now, he has to do this right. 

The drug lord is armed. Tim is thirteen. Batman has training, and Tim can barely make four park bench vaults in a row. But he can _do_ _this_. There are lives on the line. 

He just has to hold out until Batman arrives for real. He’s the distraction. 

Tim leaps onto another stack, wincing at the _clang_ his landing makes. He hits the deck, waits for the gunfire to stop, jabs play on his phone’s voice memo app. 

“Scarecrow,” and that’s Batman’s growl coming out, echoing, hopefully strongly enough that Scarecrow won’t realize it’s not just from a speaker. There’s a thud on the side of his stack, and a laugh from Dr. Crane, and Tim _books it._

_Come on Batman, COME ON BATMAN,_ and Tim is in the _worst_ game of cat-and-mouse he’s ever played in his life. The container stacks are endless, and he’s so tired. Scarecrow has started throwing gas bombs everywhere he runs. The air is clouding over, turning into a toxic fog. Tim wedges himself in a gap just long enough to yank out the standard Gotham gas mask he always packs for these nights, but it’s only rated for ten minutes in one of Crane’s concoctions. Tim’s on a timer now, and he’ll have to either accept a fear gassing or bail when it runs out. 

There’s panic among the rows of stacks now, as lackeys and low level criminals get hit by the toxin. Panicked firing starts up everywhere, and Tim hopes all the police are staying well clear, gearing up the tactical teams they’ve no doubt trucked in. 

_Come on, Batman._

* * *

Tim’s got less than a minute left of safe air. He can’t see where he is anymore, and at this point he doesn’t care. He’s just picked a direction and he’s _running_ . He’s down at the ground now, because speed and surprise are the only advantages he has at this point. And so far, there haven’t been any gunshots from up ahead. 

“Crane,” he hears, deep gravel in a human throat, and _oh thank god. Finally._

There’s intense banging behind him now, and an enraged yell from Scarecrow. Batman grunts. Tim keeps running. 

Right off the edge of the harbor platform.

He only has time to let out one shout of surprise when the ground drops away suddenly, and thenhe’s hitting the icy water, gasping out what little precious air is still in his lungs. Tim struggles to the surface, breaks it with a deep gasp. He’s got maybe a minute, maybe two before he can’t keep himself up anymore. And Tim isn’t familiar with the harbor. 

He swims along the shore as best he can. 

Tim’s arms are turning to ice, and then to heavy warm lead, and then to nearly nothing at all. He’s a battery, being drained to zero from the outside in, layer by layer by layer, each part powering down to black like an old TV. And he’s just so tired. He’s beginning to slip, head dipping below the surface over and over now, like one of the drinking bird toys he remembers from elementary school. 

And then suddenly there’s an arm hooking around him, armpit to armpit, and he’s yanked upwards like a shot. 

“I’ve got you, it’s okay, I got you,” and it’s Jason. Robin. Tim is shivering too hard to speak. 

Robin lets go of the grapple line and hauls Tim onto flat ground, yanking a metallic space blanket out of a pouch from his belt. Tim always loved those as a kid—couldn’t believe how small they folded up, how well the foil really _did_ trap and reflect heat energy. His parents thought they were stupid, and never let him buy one from the museum gift shop. 

_Good thing Batman didn’t agree with them,_ he thinks, distantly, and Robin is yelling something, _Batman,_ maybe_,_ he thinks, and.

No. No no no no no _no_. Tim can’t—his disguise is good but it’s _Batman_, and he’s too _tired_, he’s so cold, he can’t think straight—he can’t lie properly to Batman like _this_ —

Large arms are under him, and he’s being lifted like he weighs nothing, held tight against a strong chest for the second time in as many weeks. But this time there’s kevlar and body armor and a thick cape, not soft jersey knit, and he’s cold, not hot. 

But the words are the same, Tim realizes, blinking up in spotty street lighting at his hero, and when Batman says _It’s going to be okay_, _I’ve got you,_ Tim can almost believe it.

#### Notes:

I REALLY HOPE YOU LIKED THIS. I never end things with a cliffhanger like this, so I hope it was alright! I probably won't do any other cliffhangers for the rest of the story.  Next chapter should be up tomorrow evening or night, don't worry, I'll get it written :)
