# and i can't go back, back to how it was

> Tim is adjusting. Can he MAYBE stop Realizing Things yet, please? For like? Two seconds? Also, freezie pops.

#### Notes:

This is mostly a (lower quality, sorry!!!!) filler chapter to give everyone a breather after the Massive Ride the last two were! Next chapter will be more involved again.

**CONTENT WARNING:** mentions of past incidents of child abuse. nothing graphically described.

* * *

Tim has parked himself carefully out of sight on the GCPD main precinct, fifteen minutes ahead of the time Batman and Robin usually swing in. Gordon should be out any second now.

He feels surprisingly anxious about the conversation he’s about to have, although he figures it could also be nerves about being back on the streets for the first time in weeks creeping up on him. It’s not like anything’s changed in the time BatWatch has been on hiatus—Gotham is still as _Gotham_ as ever, and no new Rogues have come onto the scene recently, thank goodness. 

Although, Tim’s personal life has changed a lot. There is that. 

The rooftop door opens, spitting out Commissioner Gordon. Tim can see exhaustion rolling off of him in waves, _but hey, what else is new?_ Gordon scans the area out of habit, then paces over the damp pea gravel and flips on the Bat-Signal. 

Tim steps out of the shadows. 

“Hi, Commissioner,” he says quietly. Fiddles with the camera strap around his neck. 

Gordon whirls around, hand on his holster, then relaxes after a beat. “Oh. It’s _you_. Don’t scare me like that, kid, my heart can only handle a certain quota per week. And I already work with the Bats.”

“Sorry,” Tim can’t help laughing quietly. “Felt like being dramatic.”

“Hm,” says Gordon, but he’s smiling a little under the mustache. He folds his arms, gives Tim a clear once-over. “So. You’ve been out of commission for a while.”

Tim kicks at the gravel. “Yeah. Some things came up.”

“You need any help?”

Tim blinks. That’s...really kind. The commissioner sounds like he’s serious about the offer.

“Thanks,” Tim says. “But I’ve got some people looking out for me now. That’s—some stuff happened, and I guess you could say I finally realized some things. I’ve got backup now, you’ll be happy to hear that,” he offers. 

“Ecstatic,” Gordon says dryly. “I weep tears of joy.”

“Also, the Bats and I know about each other now, just so you know,” Tim adds. Gordon raises an eyebrow. Tim looks away. “So. I’ll just give Batman any photos that need to get to you from now on, I guess. And not send random kids to your precinct with no warning anymore.”

“Shame,” Gordon says. “I’ll miss having feisty little hellions showing up to demand warm food and a private audience. Makes life interesting around here.”

“Sorry for your loss. But Batman’s going to start taking a more proactive approach with the street kids.” Tim’s smile is large and genuine now. “So, bummer that you won’t see them as much, but it’s going to be much better overall.”

“Yeah, I imagine it will,” Gordon muses. “Heard something on the radio about Bruce Wayne donating the money to open a couple new youth shelters.”

“That’s real generous of him,” Tim says.

“Mm. Sure is.”

“Well,” Tim says, glancing out at the city. “I need to go if I want to get in position for some shots. But I wanted to swing by and just...let you know I’m not gone, I guess. And I’m taking some of your advice. It’s nice having someone watching my back on comms.”

“Glad you were actually listening that night.” Gordon’s lip twitches up ever so slightly. “Hey, kid?” 

Tim turns from where he’s about to swing himself over the roof’s edge. 

“Yeah?” he asks.

Gordon hesitates. “Are you...you’re okay, though, right? Really?”

“Were you worried?” Tim grins. Gordon sighs. 

"Kid."

“I’m…” Tim brushes his bangs out of his eyes, considers what he wants to say. This wig is turning out to be a little more annoying than expected. “I will be,” he says finally. “I’m working on it.”

“Okay,” says Gordon. He takes a step back and smiles. “It’s good to have you back on the beat.”

Tim salutes loosely, then drops over the edge onto a balcony below. 

* * *

“He’s a good kid,” Batman tells Gordon, looking out at the horizon. 

“I know. He needs good people,” Gordon returns.

“I like to think he’s getting some now.”

“Oh, I think he is,” Gordon says, “better late than never, right?” And that’s the end of that. 

But Gordon could swear he catches a small Batman-smile out of the corner of his eye before he turns around far enough to allow the man to vanish into the night unseen, as usual. 

* * *

Things are strange, in the weeks after Lockout Day. Not bad, necessarily, but...Tim’s routine, ordinary life was basically shattered overnight. And he’s supposed to pick up the pieces. But he’s quickly realizing that he can’t even trust himself to know _which_ pieces to pick up, most of the time. 

Some of them are fine, but some—he reaches out to touch them and ends up with bleeding hands and a bruised heart.

“I want to stop Realizing Things,” Tim groans into a couch cushion. His cheeks are tacky and flushed from his most recent crying episode, this one brought on by a scene in the book he was reading. (Seeing as this particular book had done it to him three times already in the past couple of days, he’s beginning to suspect Jason had ulterior motives when he recommended it to Tim. Just a little. Just a smidge.)

Dick pats his head gently. “There there. May I offer you a blue freezie pop in these trying times?”

Tim considers this for a moment.

“Yeah, alright,” he says. He rolls off the couch and drops to the floor with a satisfying _thud_. “Want to play some Halo?”

“Okay,” Dick says, and they don’t talk about it, and it’s all right. 

* * *

_Apparently_, good parents are supposed to teach you to “process emotions”, and apparently, most of the time that means you have to “sit with them patiently, feel them, and then gently move on when they’re over.” Or something like that. Simple in theory, surprisingly difficult in practice. 

Tim’s carefully avoiding the bigger feelings for now, unless he’s around Bruce, because he doesn’t know how to handle it yet if he starts dissociating while by himself. He doesn’t really want to know what his body will do if left on autopilot for too long. 

But as Bruce keeps telling him, these things happen. If Bruce and Jason both say that it will eventually get less overwhelming, Tim believes them. He’s just got to wait. 

* * *

Tim shuffles into the manor’s main kitchen, dragging the oversized blanket behind him and squinting through barely open eyes. Tim Drake may be many, many things, but a morning person he is _not_. 

The only two in there are Alfred (of course), and Dick (more surprising). Tim pauses in the middle of the floor and stares at Dick for a moment. He’s sitting up on a countertop humming and chowing down on a bowl of extremely colorful cereal.

“Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids,” Tim says. “You’re a grown up, hand them over.”

Dick throws the cereal box at Tim’s face. 

“I’m still B’s kid, I can do what I want,” Dick laughs. 

“Why are you so freakishly _awake,”_ groans Jason, walking through the door. He folds himself in half across the table top while his feet are still firmly on the floor and closes his eyes. “I oughtta call the cops on you for being this cheerful. It’s _illegal_.”

Tim snorts.

“I _am_ the cops,” Dick points out serenely, and jabs his spoon back into the sea of unnaturally colorful milk. 

“Omelettes will be ready in two minutes,” Alfred interrupts, before the two older boys can start bantering. 

_“Yes,”_ Jason hisses into the hardwood. Dick makes a pleased noise around a mouthful of cereal.

“Thanks, Alfred,” Tim says politely.

“It’s my pleasure, dear boy.” Alfred smiles. 

Bruce walks in the door, half-dressed for work. He’s already looking over the daily paper, barely seeming to notice when Alfred walks up and begins to deftly tie his tie in a windsor knot smooth it out against the dress shirt. 

“Morning, pops,” Jason slurs from his spot on the tabletop. Bruce looks up from the paper, blinks, and after a few moments of consideration, gently picks Jason up and deposits him upright in a chair. Tim can’t help but laugh from how much it reminded him of a mother cat wrangling a wayward kitten. 

“Good morning, Bruce,” Tim offers, finally taking his own seat and reaching into the Trix box to grab a handful of dry cereal.

“Good morning, Tim,” Bruce says warmly. “And to you too, chum.” 

Dick waves his spoon and smiles wide between his cereal-stuffed hamster cheeks, eyes crinkling up. 

“Where’d the Tabasco sauce go?” Jason asks, finally coming to life a little. He heaves himself up from the chair. “Are we out? I don’t see it on the rack.”

“Look behind the Sriracha, I think it got shoved back further,” Bruce answers. 

“Ah. There it is.” Jason turns around and looks at Tim and Dick. “Hey, Dickiebird, Timbo, you want sauces for your eggs?” 

“I’ll take Sriracha,” Dick says, setting his cereal bowl in the dishwasher. “I like pizazz in my eggs, not boring old man hot sauce.”

“No thanks,” Tim says to Jason. “I’ve been hot sauced too many times to eat it willingly on anything besides stir fry.”

Bruce looks up.

“Hot sauced?” Dick asks. 

“Yeah, you know, like soap? If someone’s too disrespectful or says a bad word or something, parents in old TV shows are like _‘I’m gonna wash your mouth out with soap, young man, raaah! Go to the bathroom!’_ Except with hot sauce instead, because it’s, y’know, actually an edible food and not a cleaning agent.” Tim eyebrows pinch together slightly. “Although I think I vaguely remember getting my mouth washed out with soap once or twice too when we were at Grandma’s old house, since she didn’t have sauce. It was gross. Definitely didn’t sass my mom again that day, it was pretty effective.”

“Tim,” Jason starts, and it comes out sounding strangled. And, _oh no,_ Tim realizes, with the sense of dawning shame and stress that’s all too familiar lately. 

_Oh No, the thing that I just said is apparently one of the things that other people Don’t Think Is Okay that I didn’t realize, and Now I’ve Made People Sad And They’re Wasting Emotions On Me, but it’s FINE, really, it is._  

“It’s fine,” Tim says, a little desperately. “Come on. Hot sauce isn’t fun, but it isn’t a _bad_ thing. It works! It’s even an appropriate consequence, right?” 

Bruce and Alfred are trying to teach him about Appropriate Consequences lately—making sure the punishment fits the crime instead of just being pulled from a hat, or just anger. _If you’re not allowed to do it to an adult or a prisoner in jail, you shouldn’t do it to a child,_ is a general rule of thumb Bruce taught Tim. Which, yeah, that’s fair. But this is just hot sauce. It’s not a big deal. 

“If you’re using your mouth to be disrespectful or cuss, then your mouth is what gets punished, right?” Tim says. He’s fairly confident Bruce will back him up on this one. Dick looks pained, Jason looks vaguely horrified, but Bruce just looks calm. _That’s a good sign,_ Tim thinks.

“Tim,” Bruce says, evenly. 

“Bruce,” Tim says back.

“What does hot sauce _do?”_

“It activates certain receptors and sends nerve signals to the brain that are processed as heat,” Tim recites. 

“Right. And if that heat is more than an individual’s enjoyment threshold, what does the sensation become?”

Tim frowns. “Uh. Painful?”

“And don’t children have more sensitive senses of taste than adults do?”

“Yeah, of course,” Tim says. 

“So,” Bruce says, so patiently. “If a hot sauce is too hot for you when you’re older, and that’s _painful_, how does it feel to you if you’re younger?”

“More...painful…?”

“And if you force someone to eat something that causes them physical pain, that would be…”

“Oh,” says Tim, feeling suddenly much smaller than his age. “Oh.” 

“C’mere,” Bruce sighs, and holds out his arms. 

“But...soap is toxic,” Tim says, brain stuck somewhere in a skipping CD phase. Still trying to cling to his previous understanding. 

“Yes, which is why _soap_ is wrong. But just because capsaicin is something technically safer for humans to eat, that doesn’t mean it’s right to put it in a child’s mouth. And it’s technically a toxin to us too, anyway. We just like it much more than soap.”

“But...” Tim is still saying, sadly, and then Dick is picking him up out of his chair in a bear hug, and carrying him over to be dropped in front of Bruce. “But it wasn’t a big deal,” Tim tries to explain. 

Bruce just pulls him in for a hug. Tim sighs.

“Not now that you’re _big_, it isn’t,” Jason chips in from the other side of the table. He’s already cheerfully pouring Tabasco sauce on one of Alfred’s beautiful omelettes. “But you weren’t big _then_. How did little you feel?”

Tim thinks back, cheek smooshed into Bruce’s shoulder. “I don’t know,” he’s surprised to report. “It just...happened. That’s all.”

“It’ll come back at some point,” Jason says confidently. “You’re just not ready to feel it yet. That’s okay. You’ve got time.”

“Why do I have to keep _feeling things?”_ Tim complains, and Bruce lets go at last and shoves him gently towards his own omelette. “This is the _worst_.”

“Give it time,” Alfred says. “This is a marathon, not a sprint.”

“I always did suck at cross-country,” Tim grumbles. But he salts his omelette anyway, and lets the family fold him into the warm, easy conversation of a Sunday brunch, and it feels a little bit like the places he been breaking are starting to grow into new wholes. 

* * *

Ace has started hanging around Tim a lot more, ever since that night. Which is _great_ . 

“I always wanted a dog,” Tim mentions while lying on the lounge’s enormous rug during family movie night. “But Mom doesn’t like things with fur.”

“She just doesn’t know what she’s missing,” Dick says, fondly scratching a particular spot on Ace’s flank. “_What a good boy you are!_ Yes!” 

“Hey Bruce?” Tim asks.

“Mm?”

“Did you train Ace to lay on people?”

“Alfred and I did, yes. When Jason first came to us, he was dealing with a lot of issues too, including dissociation. Pressure helped him feel more grounded, but the weighted blankets made him feel too trapped.”

“There was. A thing, once,” Jason says, aiming for casual and almost succeeding. But there’s still a hint of pain in his tone. Tim doesn’t pry. “I don’t like being pressed in on by fabric. ‘S why I keep the cape short and narrow.”

“So we did some task training with Ace,” Bruce continues, as he reaches out a hand and slowly rubs Jason’s head. “He was originally a guide dog, so he’s a fast learner and already has a strong foundation.”

“What other tasks did you teach him?” Tim asks. He lies down and wiggles for a few moments until he’s pressed up against the dog’s solid warmth. He closes his eyes, and keeps softly running his fingers along the short fur between Ace’s ears.

“He knows ‘Get Bruce,’” Jason says. “He’ll find and retrieve Bruce if he’s anywhere in the manor.”

“And he alerts to panic attacks,” Dick adds, “although no one’s had one for a good while now.”

“Thank god for therapy,” Jason mutters. “Woo hoo.”

“Thank god for therapy,” Bruce agrees. “Can you imagine if we didn’t go to Black Canary? Who knows what we would gotten tangled up in by now.”

“Perish the thought!” Dick says in a pretty good imitation of Alfred. He clutches a hand to his chest dramatically, and topples off the hassock.

Tim laughs, and he really feels it. 

* * *

Bruce has kept his word and is taking care of all the custody talk without Tim having to worry about much of it. But one day after the first few weeks have passed, right when Tim is really starting to get comfortable in Wayne Manor and feel like things will work out, Bruce knocks on the door of the room Tim’s sorta-not-quite-all-the-way claimed as his own. 

He looks like someone made him eat several lemons, and then wash them down with cheap whiskey.

Tim swallows.

“Bruce?”

“Tim,” Bruce says, and _oh no._ That’s his heavy voice. It’s the _this is less than stellar news, but chin up, we’ll find a way through—but yeah, this is pretty bad, sorry_ voice. “We’ve run into a roadblock with the custody fight.”

“Oh?” Tim asks. “What kind of roadblock?”

“Your parents,” and here Bruce has to take a deep breath before looking Tim in the eyes, “are insisting that you come home. They said you’re an unlawful runaway, and they’re willing to call the police to have you removed from my home and prosecute me if we don’t agree.”

“Oh,” Tim says faintly. And. Well. He guesses he should have expected this. 

Ace and Jason, who Tim could swear can just smell when he’s getting upset, quietly come through the doorway and settle down pressed up against Tim in solidarity. He absently scratches behind one of Ace’s ears.

“I’m not going to force you to leave here, not ever. And that’s a promise,” Bruce says. “But we also can’t afford to have the police get involved.”

“So what’s the plan?” Tim asks. “You always have one. Hit me.”

Bruce smiles, finally. “New Jersey,” he says, slowly, “is a one-party state. Which means that there only needs to be consent from one party for a conversation or interaction to be recorded.”

Tim’s eyes widen as he processes this. 

“So you want—”

“I want to set you up with a hidden microphone and camera, yes,” Bruce says. “And as soon as we get a few pieces of evidence that are convincing enough, you can leave and we’ll go to the family court ourselves. If the police get called, they’ll have to take our side based on the evidence.”

“That’s a good plan,” Tim says, approvingly. 

“Yeah, except for the part where it involves you going back to the people we don’t want you anywhere near again,” Jason growls.

“They’re my _parents_,” Tim says sharply, and he’s kind of surprised by the swirl of emotions that clash within the phrase. He’s fiercely defensive, protective, in pain, _and_ yearning. Yeah, they may have hurt him, even if he doesn’t like _accepting_ that yet. But they’re not bad people, they’re not hurtful all the time. And they’re still his family. Even if they’re not the healthiest for him to live with, he doesn’t want to cut off all contact forever. They’re his _mom and dad_.

“Whatever,” Jason sighs. “I just don’t like it.”

“Neither do I,” says Bruce. “But the quicker we get it over with, the quicker Tim is back with us. Hopefully for good.”

“And I can use this as a chance to get the things from my room that I still want,” Tim adds. “It’s not all bad.”

“We’re going to regret this,” Jason warns. He hugs Tim fiercely, and Tim can feel the tension in the other boy’s whole body. 

“Most likely,” Bruce agrees. “But the alternative is to lose Tim, probably for good. We’ll handle whatever else happens, as long as it doesn’t come to that.”

* * *

Tim lasts three days. Then he calls Bruce, and climbs out the bedroom window with two backpacks and one duffel bag, and only looks back twice.

According to Bruce’s lawyers, he racks up seven recordings of verbal abuse, one (more) incident of emotional abuse via property destruction, and his very first lasting mark from a physical hit. So that’s a nice parting gift.

It hadn’t actually been any harder a slap than his mom had given him before, but Tim was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and his head hit the cabinet door knob when tipped off kilter. 

It didn’t even need stitches. He was _lucky_, according to the ER staff who looked it over. No concussion, shouldn’t leave a scar. 

Tim just wants to go _home_. 

Tim’s talked to nurses and police and a social worker and lawyers, because Bruce wanted things moving forward as quickly as possible. And the logician in Tim appreciates that. But right now? He’s so _tired_. Bruce carries him in from the car when they pull into the manor’s garage that evening. 

“I can walk just fine,” he tries, halfheartedly, when Bruce first scoops him up. 

“I know,” says Bruce. “But as far as I can tell, your parents didn’t touch you for three days. If that’s how you’ve been living all the time for years, you must be touch starved to kingdom come and very good at hiding it. Why didn’t you say anything?”

Tim lets himself melt into Bruce’s hold, then. He doesn’t want to ever be put down again, really. Bruce, seeming to sense it, squeezes him tighter.

“I just don’t want...to be a bother,” Tim says, voice very small.

Bruce kisses the crown of his head through his unruly hair. “Tim,” he says, serious. “You are never, ever a bother to us. We’ll keep showing you as many times as you need, okay? Just promise me you’ll try to believe that as best you can for now.”

“Okay,” Tim says, and then whispers, just for Bruce to hear: “I love you. Thank you for not giving up on me.”

Bruce pushes the door open to his bedroom, where Jason, Dick, and Ace are already waiting for them, sprawled out in a heap on Bruce’s California king size bed watching episode who-knows-what of a Star Trek binge. 

“Never,” Bruce whispers back. “I love you too, Tim. Everything is going to be okay.”

And Tim really trusts him that it will. It’s small, and fragile, but it’s there. For once, Tim is going to let himself believe that things aren’t going to go wrong. And right now, he’s got almost-brothers and a dog and the closest thing to a good parent figure he’s ever known waiting for him to join the puppy pile so they can hang out, just to make Tim feel better after a terrible past few days. 

Tim snuggles into the center of the bed, managing to somehow touch every one of the others. 

“Freezie pop?” Dick asks him, his own lips already starting to stain purple. The theme song starts to roll for The Original Series, and Jason sings along to the instrumental music, and Bruce laughs.

“Yeah,” Tim says, and smiles. “I want green.”

And yeah, it’s been a lousy few days. But he’s got a family he’s growing into, with a place they’re carving out just for him. Tim doesn’t know what tomorrow will bring, at this point, but for right now, for this night? 

He’s going to be okay.

#### Notes:

I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT please remember to stay hydrated and eat something small at least, and take any meds you need! Have a lovely night/day! 

My sister is having a baby tomorrow, and I'm watching a baby and then her kids in the evening, and bringing her food, so I'll probably get the next chapter up later than usual. But it'll happen!
