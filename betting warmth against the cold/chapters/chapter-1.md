# I hope we’ll be better than the past

> It’s Tim’s first Christmas as an official member of the Wayne family. He’s struggling with some mixed feelings and old wounds, but luckily Bruce and his brothers are there to walk him through it.

It’s about to be Tim’s first Christmas as an official part of the Wayne family, and boy is _that_ a weird sentence to think to himself.

_Tim_, who’s always already had parents and a house, even if those two things didn’t often mix. Tim, who never in a million years thought he’d end up in the foster care system. Tim, who had been watching Wayne Manor from afar for _years_, always aching a little for the easy way they seemed to all get along, even during the worst of Jason’s rocky first year after getting taken in. _Tim’s_ part of the Manor now, in legality and spirit, even if not in name. 

“Penny for your thoughts, Tim?”

Tim turns away from the windowpane, wiggling around on the squishy old loveseat cushions, to see Bruce walking into the library, smiling. 

“Hi Bruce,” Tim says quietly. “Just...watching the snow. Thinking about how much things have changed.”

“Mm,” says Bruce. He sits down next to Tim, giving him space, and tucks the fleece throw a little more snugly around Tim’s toes before patting them precisely twice. Tim’s lip twitch up into a smile as he looks back out at the falling snow. 

“There have definitely been a large number of changes for all of us this year,” Bruce says quietly, now looking out the window as well. “It would be a lot for anyone to deal with. Are you okay?” 

Tim sighs.

“Yeah,” he says. “Nothing’s wrong or anything.” Tim spends a few long moments picking at some loose yarn on the blanket’s edging, picking, pulling, _twisting_. Bruce gently catches Tim’s fingers in his own warm, calloused hand. Tim looks up for a second before staring at his lap.

“But are you okay?” Bruce prods, again. 

“I’m fine,” Tim says, a bit of frustration creeping into his tone. “It’s not like—I’m doing fine, okay, being Robin is _awesome_, my sessions with Dinah are good, everything in life is going really really well right now. Like, shockingly great.”

“That’s all good, and I’m glad,” Bruce says. “But Tim. I’m not asking about your life. I’m asking about _you_.”

Tim doesn’t know why this makes him so angry and longing at the same time. He wants to shout Bruce all the way out of the room, just _absolutely_ _lay into him_ until he backs off. But he also wants someone to ask about him like this, to not just let it go when Tim says he’s fine. Tim knows it’s stupid and childish of him, to think and act like this. It’s not the first time in recent months that Tim’s dealt with this _frustrating_ dichotomy of emotional combos, and it hasn’t gotten any easier each time it’s happened. 

_“Why,”_ Tim grouses, narrowly keeping in the _“—do you care?”_ that his mouth wants to tack onto the end of it. That’s not fair to Bruce. All he’s done since he’s met Tim is show over and over again how much he cares. Why is Tim so suspicious? There are mountains of evidence of all the times that Bruce has genuinely wanted to know about Tim’s wellbeing and taken Tim seriously.

It’d be nice if Tim’s brain could get the memo.

“Because I’m a little worried about you, kiddo,” Bruce says. He brushes some of Tim’s flyaway strands behind his ear, fingers feather-light against Tim’s cheek. “You’ve been pretty quiet today. Also, Dick threatened to lick my pancakes in the morning if I didn’t sort out whatever’s going on with you before the movie marathon.”

Tim lets out a sharp little breath that’s two notches down from a laugh. He can’t help tilting his cheek oh-so-slightly into Bruce’s touch—the man’s knuckles still haven’t left Tim’s cheekbone and continue rubbing small circles even now.

“I’m okay,” he says, voice smaller than he would like. Tim clears his voice, tries again. “I’m…coping admirably.”

Bruce laughs, a quiet, real sound. Nothing like his public persona. 

“You listen to Jason’s dramatic speeches too much,” Bruce says. He moves his hands to cup Tim’s face on both sides, thumbs sweeping over Tim’s cheeks once, twice. “You want to come over here and talk about it?”

Tim hesitates for several seconds. He’s good on his own. He likes space. That’s why he came to the corner of the library in the first place. But he loves Bruce hugs more than almost everything, too. Nothing makes him feel as safe. And it’s not like sitting by himself has helped him actually feel any better, so he might as well try to follow Dinah’s advice and actually talk through things with someone else for once. It’s hard to remember he’s not on his own for everything sometimes. He doesn’t want to bother other people for things he should be able to handle on his own, especially when he knows almost everything passes with time anyway.

But today is Christmas Eve. He’s tired of feeling confused. 

Tim scoots across the gap, and Bruce reaches for him, helping Tim twist around and settle down in Bruce’s lap like a much smaller kid. Bruce pulls his knees up, settles into the loveseat more firmly. Tim leans into Bruce’s chest a little more heavily and spends a couple of minutes just listening to Bruce’s heartbeat under his ear. Slow. Even. Not leaving anytime soon. 

Tim appreciates how Bruce is okay with just sitting and not pushing for Tim to talk. He loves Jason and Dick, but neither of them are as content in silence as Bruce always seems to be. They want to tackle things and get them resolved. But sometimes Tim’s just not ready, or it’s not the right situation. 

Bruce seemed to understand pretty early on that it’s easier for Tim to talk when he’s not in a face-on conversation, so somehow Tim ends up in the passenger seat of Bruce’s car a _lot_. There’s been an interesting uptick in the number of errands run in the Wayne household since Tim came to stay permanently, but Tim isn’t about to let on that he’s noticed. 

Tim closes his eyes in Bruce’s hold, basking in the warmth of his foster father and the blanket they now share. Bruce is like a furnace most days. 

“I know I’m supposed to not care about them,” Tim whispers finally. “But I miss my mom and dad.”

“You’re allowed to feel however you need to,” Bruce chides him immediately. “They’re your _parents,_ regardless of how good or bad of a job they did of it. It’s okay to miss them. They’re not evil, and it’s the holidays. I’m sorry they still haven’t called yet.”

“No, see, it’s stupid,” Tim says. “They do this. I’m not even surprised. It’s—I miss them, I miss them so much. But they hardly even come home for Christmas or Hanukkah. I don’t understand why I miss them when they’re _never even here._ ”

“They’re still your parents,” Bruce says again. “It’s normal. You want them to love you still and spend time with you. There’s nothing wrong with that.”

“But I want it to _stop_,” Tim says. “I’m tired of being confused. I just want to enjoy the holidays.”

“I know, buddy,” Bruce murmurs gently, pressing his nose into the top of Tim’s head “I know it’s really hard. You’re doing a great job.”

“Thanks,” Tim sighs.

“Do you want me to try to get in contact with them through a couple contacts on our end?” 

Tim thinks for a minute. He has no doubt Bruce would be able to find Tim’s parents pretty quickly if he set his mind and resources to it. He’s Batman. And Tim is Robin now, with all the tools that title carries with it—he could probably find them too, if he worked at it for a few hours. But…

“No,” says Tim, so quietly. His eyes water—he guesses with all the business of the holidays, Alfred hasn’t been dusting the library quite as regularly. “They can—they can call me or not. I need to stop waiting for them so much. I have a different home now. There’s actually people this year.”

Bruce squeezes him tightly for a few moments.

“Mrs. Mac always goes to visit her family over in Ireland for the end of the year,” Tim whispers, turning into Bruce’s neck like he’s telling a secret. And maybe he is, really. “So even she wouldn’t be at the house either. But she usually left me some tupperware containers to reheat for the big day. And she’d _always_ leave a really fun pop-up card with some kind of foreign money in it.”

“She sounds like a nice woman.”

“Yeah. But—” Tim sniffs for real now. _Goddamnit_ , he thinks. _Not again. I go years never really crying and now that I’m with the coolest family in Gotham, I have to turn into a leaky faucet? How is this fair?_

“What, kiddo?” Bruce murmurs. 

“It was so _empty_,” Tim says. “The _stupid_ house. That stupid—it was so empty, with the stupid giant Christmas tree—we didn’t even put it up ourselves, Mom hired someone to do it while I was at school or something. It was gorgeous. But it was so boring. What’s the point of having a tree or a fire if there’s no one to watch them?” Tim takes a couple of deep breaths. “I used to. Um.”

Bruce makes an encouraging noise.

“After I started taking pictures of you guys,” Tim begins, slowly. “And I got pretty good at...sneaking around, and stuff. Sometimes I’d climb the trees behind your house, when I was too tired of not seeing anyone at home. And I’d watch you guys in the kitchen, or one of the lounges. Took a few pictures of your tree. I hadn’t really seen homemade ornaments before. Your tree looked so much more fun.” He sniffs. “I printed a couple of the photos and taped them up by my bed around Christmas and put some battery string lights around them so I could see it all when I went to bed. It was nice.”

Bruce sniffs, too, then.

“Last year was the best Christmas of my _life_,” Tim says. “I couldn’t believe that you all hung out with each other for two days straight. Like, not just for presents. You eat a bunch of meals, and relax in the same room, and you play games.”

“And _you_ do too, now,” Bruce says. He pulls back enough to smile at Tim. “You’re family. No take backs. You’re never going back to being alone that way ever again. I hope you know that. No matter what, I’ll never let that happen. You will _always_ have people, Tim, even if something happens to me.”

Tim shudders. “Let’s not think about that.”

“Okay, buddy.” Bruce shifts under Tim, getting a firmer grip. “You think you’re ready to hang out in the lounge with some of Alfred’s fresh cocoa? Or do you need a little time still?”

“Will you stay too?” Tim asks.

Bruce laughs. “I wouldn’t miss it for anything.”

Tim snakes his arms around Bruce’s neck tightly, burying his face in the man’s shoulder. “Okay.”

Bruce stands and hauls Tim up with him. “Boy, Timmy. You’re getting bigger. That’s a lot of muscle you’ve packed on. You’re not as much of a pipsqueak as I remember.”

“Hey!” Tim says, pretending outrage. He kicks Bruce in the ribs with one heel. “Just because I’m smaller than Jason, who is built like a tank, might I remind you, does not mean—”

“There you are,” Dick says, relief dripping from his voice as he pokes his head around the library doorway. “I was worried.”

“Hi Dick,” says Tim. He lets go of Bruce long enough to wave.

“Hey, baby bird,” Dick says, leaning over to peck a kiss on Tim’s forehead. “What’ve you been up to?”

“I was watching the snow,” Tim says. Bruce doesn’t mention anything about their talk. 

“Hm, good idea, but better done from the warm lounge bay window with warm drinks.” Dick sticks his arms out and makes a gimme gesture with his hands, fake-glaring at Bruce. “Hand over the child, mister. You’ve gotten to have your fun for long enough, the rest of us want a turn.” 

“I’m _right here,”_ Tim protests, while Bruce scowls right back, saying “I’ve only had him for a few minutes, I want more time with him too!”

Jason chooses that moment to strol around the corner, hands stuck casually in the pocket of one of Bruce’s old college hoodies. Tim wonders how long Jason has been just standing out of sight and biding his time. Probably the whole conversation, knowing Jason. 

“You know,” Jason says. “We can solve the whole problem by just all being in the same room. Or couch. Everybody gets a piece of Timmers.” He takes the opportunity to forcibly haul Tim away from Bruce’s arms.

Tim squirms around till he’s holding on to Jason like a monkey. 

“Good point,” Bruce says.” 

“Fair,” Dick agrees.

“Glad that’s settled, then,” Jason drawls. “Now I’m gonna steal Tim for a hot second and we’ll meet you in the lounge.” 

He turns and walks off with Tim, and Tim can’t help laughing at Dick and Bruce’s exchange of wry glances behind Jason’s back. 

“Should’ve known,” Dick says mournfully, looping an arm over Bruce’s shoulders. 

Bruce just chuckles and pulls Dick into a full hug before suddenly stopping and tossing his son over his shoulder in a fireman’s carry.

“Bruce!” Dick squawks in surprise. “B! _Dad,_ put me down!”

“No can do, chum,” Bruce says, grinning. “If I can’t have my youngest, I’ll just have to settle for my eldest. You were the first one I learned to do this with after all.”

Dick grumbles, but doesn’t make Bruce drop him like they all know he could. 

“You want to be dropped on the couch or an armchair?” Bruce asks.

“Couch, I guess,” Dick says, resigned.

“Done.” Bruce strides off down the hall, quickly overtaking Jason and Tim, and a few seconds after he and Dick vanish into the lounge a stream of high-pitched shrieks and laughter echo down the hall.

“Tickle attack,” Jason says, solemnly. “Moment of silence for Dickster’s dignity.”

Tim laughs.

They carry on down the hallway at a leisurely pace. Tim relaxes more, lays his head on Jason’s shoulder. They’re closer in height now than the were last Christmas, but Jason is still plenty big to hold Tim without much awkwardness. 

“Jason,” Tim starts, softly. 

“Hm?”

“How do you not feel guilty for enjoying your time with someone _else_ on the holidays? Like, I know your situation is different because your mom died. But...do you ever feel kind of like you shouldn’t be just...so happy now, when you couldn’t be with your old family?”

Jason frowns a little.

“Sometimes,” he acknowledges. “The first couple years I was living with Bruce, I used to feel guilty that I was so happy, when my parents had had such shifty lives. And then I’d _also_ feel bad because I was happier with Bruce than with my mom, even though I knew she worked really hard to try to make things as good as she could with too little money. It’s not the quite same for you, but—you’re allowed to be as happy as you want, okay? Your parents, it doesn’t matter if they’re happy or sad without you this season. They didn’t care enough to see if _you’re_ happy so far.”

Tim shakes his head, wanting to argue on principle but unable to come up with anything to really say.

“It’ll get easier,” Jason adds. “Time is gonna pass, and you’re going to get used to having other people to help, and being able to be young, and being happy.”

“Promise?” Tim asks.

“Promise.” Jason hikes him up a little higher. “I’ll never lie to you, Timmers.” 

“Okay,” Tim says. He kisses Jason’s ear. “I love you so much. Thank you for not leaving me alone last year. You’re super annoying, just for the record, but I’m glad you’re my big brother.”

“Shut up, dude, you’re gonna make me cry.” Jason pokes Tim in the side, and he shrieks for a second. “Want to go gang up on Bruce in a tickle fight? If we start, Dick’ll get in on it in a second, and B can’t take down all of us at once.” 

“Let’s _go_,” Tim says happily. Jason starts to sprint, quiet as only a Bat can be while flying down a hallway.

Things aren’t quite perfect. And he’s still a little confused, and a little hurt, and a little sad. But he’s a _lot_ happy, and warmer than he’s been for most of the holidays he’s ever had, and all in all?

Tim thinks it’s going to be a pretty good Christmas.
