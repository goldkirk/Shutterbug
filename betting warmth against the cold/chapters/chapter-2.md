# a mended heart, by a thousand stitches

> It's Christmas day. The family attempts a new tradition, like they do every year. Pokemon, pancakes, and perfectly planned presents occur. Tim gets reminded that he does not need his parents' approval to be worthy of love, and Jason's protective streak goes out the window when he has shenanigans to plan—unfortunately for Tim. But all turns out well, in the end.

#### Notes:

I typed most of this on my phone again in the back of a minivan with children asking nonstop about computers and how they record and process via time and why clocks are important, and also it is Very Late At Night, so please forgive any typos or weird bits. I'll clean up both chapters later after a good sleep haha.

* * *

He wakes up warm, tangled up in three thick blankets, and wedged snugly in the corner where the two walls met behind his mattress. Tim lets out a contented sigh, burrows his face little further into the nest he often creates in his sleep. 

“Timbit,” a voice whispers, _right_ in his ear, and Tim jerks backwards. His eyes shoot open as his head hits the solid drywall with a painful _thunk_, and oh, _look_. There’s Jason, face inches from Tim’s. 

“Oh god,” Tim wheezes. 

“Shit!” hisses Jason, sounding actually rather sorry. “Didn’t mean to scare you like that. I was trying to keep it quiet.” 

Tim shoves up from his tangle of covers and scrubs at one eye. He sighs. “...Why?”

“It’s Christmas, dummy,” Jason says, pulling at various blankets in an effort to help Tim wiggle free. 

“And that’s supposed to explain you watching me sleep _how_, exactly?” 

“We need to go wake up Dick. I got up stupid early for this, Timbo, and we are going to surprise _Dick_ for once if it kills us.”

“Um,” says Tim, struggling to string enough words together to mount any solid protest. Jason drags him out of bed by one arm.

“Too many years,” Jason mutters darkly. “Too many years, I have laid in my perfectly good bed in this stupidly large house and been woken up by that hobbledehoy launching himself on top of me like he’s three instead of twenty-three. I won’t stand for it.”

"_Hobbledehoy?_ ” Tim echoes, incredulously.

“Shut up,” Jason says kindly. They stop in front of Dick’s door. “Listen,” Jason says, leaning down a little and putting both hands on Tim’s shoulders. “We have probably two more minutes before Bruce’s Dad-Bat senses start tingling, so we gotta get on the same page fast." 

Tim nods, desperately trying to suppress his sleepy yawn and look at least mostly with it.

“We will open the door slowly,” Jason says, one hand sweeping in a broad gesture. “I oiled the hinges last night, so it won’t squeak. “Then, I’m going to sneak up to the foot of the bed and get ready to jump, and you’re going to go up by Dick’s head. When I give the signal, we both jump onto Dick and try to hold him down while we tickle his weak spots.”

This is a _terrible_ plan. Horrible. They’re all vigilantes. Dick is a world-class acrobat with years of ingrained attack reactions. _Oh my god, we’re going to die,_ Tim thinks.

“Got it,” he says. “What’s the signal?”

“I’m gonna yell _‘_ Surprise, motherfucker!’” Jason says cheerfully. “Dick won’t know what hit him. _Trust_ me.”

* * *

“SURPRISE, MOTHERFUCKER,” Jason hollers in a _terrible_ imitation of the meme, and they _leap_. 

There are twin battle cries that Wonder Woman herself would shed a tear at, and then there’s a frankly _godawful_ amount of shrieking, several _thwacks_, four seconds of uncontrollable laughter, and then an absolute _marvel_ of a bodily _yeet_, and Tim is flying through the air just long enough to think _okay, so this could have gone a bit better, probably_ before he hits and _bounces_. 

Bruce skids through the doorway just in time for his alarmed “What the _fuck_,” to coincide with Tim’s odd little _hrnk!_ noise as he ricochets _right_ off of Dick’s firmly-inflated exercise ball and straight into the mahogany dresser.

Jason groans where he lies upside-down, dangling halfway off of Dick’s mattress.  

_“Timmy!”_ Dick practically squeaks, and scrambles out of bed in Tim’s last-known direction. 

Bruce hauls Jason upright and steadies him by the upper arms, quickly surveying his _truly delightful angel_ of a second child for any obvious signs of damage. 

“Report?” Bruce rumbles.

“‘M good, B,” Jason sighs. “Sorry. Just a little bruised.”

“Hm,” says Bruce, and he turns to where Dick has scooped Tim up and perched him on the other side of the bed. “Tim?” 

There’s a moment of hesitation, just long enough for Bruce to start getting concerned, and then:

“That...was _awesome_,” Tim whispers, a little dazed. “Dick. _Dick_. Throw me again.”

“Are you _nuts_,” Dick growls. 

Bruce can’t help the relieved laugh that escapes.

“Was it really _that_ fun?” Jason asks, brows furrowing. “‘Cuz if—”

“_No_,” Bruce says firmly. And: “Is he concussed at all?”

“Doesn’t seem like it,” Dick sighs. “God, Tim. I’m so sorry.”

“It was my fault,” Jason offers. 

“It usually is,” Bruce agrees lightly. He ruffles Jason’s hair into an even worse mess of curly bedhead. “Come on, gang. If we’re all up anyway, we might as well start getting breakfast ready before any of you come up with more ill-advised schemes. It’d be nice for us all to make it through at least _one_ holiday this year without any moderate to severe injuries, hm?”

“Yes, B,” all three boys chorus. 

* * *

“But seriously,” Tim tries again, while Dick gives him a piggy-back ride down the long hallway a few paces behind Bruce and Jason. “B. Bruce. Can we add ball-launching to training? Because I think it would really benefit our—”

“No, Tim,” Dick says firmly. “_No_ launching off exercise balls.”

“They do it on American Ninja Warrior all the time,” Tim points out. 

“They’re supposed to make it across them, not launch themselves off!”

“Same thing. C’mon, Bruce, it’s so fun, please?”

Bruce breathes in for several long seconds and exhales just _slightly_ above a sigh. “I’ll _think about it_,” he says, in the _don’t press me right now or it’ll be a NO_ tone that all parents seem to magically possess.

Dick’s groans echo all the way down to the kitchen.  

* * *

“Master Dick,” Alfred says, in an exasperated tone. “If you cannot avoid burning yourself another time on that skillet, you’ll have to be banished over by your father for the rest of the cooking.”

“Not the island of shame!” Dick exclaims in mock horror. “Please, Alfie, anything but that. Surely you wouldn’t put me in the same category as B. Not for this.”

Bruce grunts into his coffee mug. 

“Refrain from being quite so reckless with the cooking equipment, and perhaps we can work out a compromise,” Alfred says, expertly flipping two pancakes at once. 

“But I’m _dancing_,” Dick whines, spinning in a circle to emphasize this point as his oversized sweater jangles in several spots. 

“That thing is a monstrosity and you’re not even in time with the songs,” Jason scoffs. “Tim! Your Bulbasaur!”

“Oh no!” Tim dives for the third skillet, sliding his spatula under the funfetti Bulbasaur as quickly and smoothly as he can. He breathes a sigh of relief when it lands safely on its uncooked side, only very slightly over-browned. 

“Thanks, Jason,” Tim says, returning the fist-bump Jason throws his way.

“No problem, little bro,” Jason says. He carefully adds the finishing touches to his hand-poured Bat-symbol, then settles back on a stool to let the batter cook some. 

When the Waynes had said they were starting a new tradition of making pancakes on Christmas morning, Tim imagined stacks of fluffy golden hotcakes like he always saw on the Bisquick boxes at the grocery store, or the flatter, slightly burnt imitations that he’d tried to make a few times with the help of Mrs. Mac. 

Turns out, the Wayne family meant a pancake-cooking _challenge_. They had colored batter. They had sprinkles. They had a million toppings and add-ins and shape-formers, and Jason in particular had done a fair amount of research on what shapes were easiest to make out of runny batter. Bruce clearly had researched how to get the timing right when pouring a pancake design that had multiple layers, but unfortunately his usual Kitchen Curse kicked in. After the first minor fire broke out, Alfred gently banned Bruce back to his usual spot at the island and made him the official judge for the contest instead.

“Alfred’s just gonna win anyway,” Dick complains at that, while painstakingly pouring out some of the yellow batter to make a sort-of star, sort-of-Blubber-impersonation on top of his bubbling green Christmas tree. “We can’t hope to beat him at _cooking_.”

“Not with _that_ attitude you can’t,” Jason scolds. "Buck up. Who are you, Squidward? Bruce, Dick is doing a _pessimism_. Call Zatanna."

“Hm,” is all Alfred says, inscrutably. 

Bruce and Tim laugh, share a fond glance behind the backs of the other three. In the end, Bruce calls a four-way tie. 

“You’re all winners in my heart,” he says firmly, around a mouthful of chocolate chip and nutella pancake. 

“That’s so _sappy_,” Dick laughs. “Who are you and what did you do with Batman?”

“You’re going to give me hives, B-man,” says Jason, but his smile ruins his half-hearted protest.

Tim just leans further into Bruce’s side, nestling into the side-arm hug Bruce pulled him into as soon as he sat down. He offers Bruce his crisped funfetti Zubat—or at least. His attempt at a Zubat, anyway. 

“Reminded me of you,” he mumbles around a mouthful of blueberry pancake and syrup.

“Thank you Tim,” Bruce says quietly. “I can’t wait to try it.”

Tim thinks back over all the times his parents brushed aside his cookies, or toast he tried to get browned just the way they liked it, or tea blends he’d researched and mixed himself based on the places they’d traveled. Thinks of Bruce, now, willing to eat and compliment Tim’s slightly-burnt attempt at a pancake that looks more like a golden-brown preschool drawing of North America.

_Yeah,_ Tim thinks, listening to his family buzzing around the kitchen, warm and full of laughter and the sound of forks clinking against plates. _This...is good_. 

* * *

Tim gifts Jason a newly-released PS4 controller with special red chrome accents and a shirt that says _Momma Bird_ on it as a joke (Jason likes it unironically, and yanks it on right then and there). He gives Alfred a book of coupons for things like _good for one free laundry day off_ and _will water entire greenhouse for a day_, and so on. Dick gets a large, soft stuffed circus elephant that Tim had ordered off Etsy to look _just_ like Dick had described Zitka, which earns him a long hug and a few teary thank-yous. 

And Bruce…

Tim is having massive second thoughts about giving Bruce his gift now. The man had been so good to Tim over the past year, sure. And logically, Tim knew that Bruce didn’t seem like he would ever just dismiss something Tim had done out of hand. Even if he didn’t like it. Lord knows Tim’s seen Bruce diplomatically thank people for things a million times in his public persona. 

But this is a big risk, Tim thinks. He’s tried this before. It always hurts. And maybe it won’t this time. But maybe it will, and sure, he can live through that kind of pain, but it’s so much harder now than it used to be. Getting tastes of how much better and more relaxed and calm things can be make it all feel so much worse now when something goes wrong, like Tim’s tolerance for bad moments got completely reset. He hates that, some days.

Maybe it’ll hurt. Maybe Bruce won’t like it. But maybe he will, and Dinah keeps telling Tim to work on being more vulnerable—Tim snorts at that, and regularly quips back that he’s vulnerable in a city every night with people like the Joker trying to kill or maim him for fun. (Dinah is not impressed. “Stop deflecting, Tim,” is a common refrain during Tim’s Tuesday afternoons.) But Jason and Dick, too—they’ve both reassured Tim that they think this is a good idea, and they know Bruce pretty well by now, right? If they’re so sure, Tim should at least _try_. 

“Bruce,” Tim starts, hands behind his back as he steps up to the armchair Bruce has melted into by the fire. 

“Mm. What’s up, buddy?” Bruce smiles at Tim, a little sleepily. He pats the arm of the chair, moving his own elbow aside so Tim has room to perch. But Tim shifts his weight awkwardly from one leg to the other, glances at the old grandfather clock, the fire, Bruce’s knee. 

“I have something for you,” Tim says, wishing his throat didn’t feel so tight all of a sudden. “Um. I made it, and. It’s not that great, but I thought maybe you’d think it was kind of cool. You’ll see. Here.” He shoves a square object wrapped in gold paper and a black bow at Bruce, and hugs his ribs tightly. 

He wants nothing more than to run for another room, but contrary to Tim’s wishes, his feet are rooted to the spot and his eyes can’t seem to stray from Bruce’s face now that the deed is done. 

“Thank you, Tim,” Bruce says with one of his real smiles, looking at Tim like he means it. Tim bites his lip once, twice. Firmly clicks his teeth shut and forces himself to not gnaw on the inside of his cheek.

Bruce carefully unwraps it, lays the paper and ribbon on the floor by his chair. Opens the book. Tim closes his eyes when he sees Bruce go very, very still. 

_Bad idea,_ Tim’s mind whispers. _Bad idea, bad idea, bad idea. You should’ve just gone with a tie. How can you mess up a tie?_  

“Tim,” Bruce says, and Tim keeps his eyes firmly shut. “These are amazing.” His voice sounds a little surprised, a lot warm. But Tim can’t—he still can’t—

“Tim, buddy,” Bruce says, more softly now, and there’s a hand wrapping around Tim’s elbow. His breath hitches. “I love it,” Bruce goes on. “Hear me? Thank you for this Tim, these photos are amazing. You really have an eye for artistic shots. I don’t think I’ve ever seen pictures of our nightlife that look this great. You put this all together yourself?” 

“Yeah,” Tim whispers, finally opening his eyes. 

Bruce’s gaze flickers across Tim’s face, assessing, strategizing. He’s still smiling. 

“C’mere,” Bruce says, standing now. He puts an arm around Tim, picks up the photo book with his other hand. “I have just the right place for this.” 

Tim sees Dick and Jason watching them in his peripheral vision, but his brain is still in a looping circuit trying to accept that Bruce liked the gift. No brain power left over to wonder.

Bruce walks them over to one of the fancy display tables ringing the lounge, with old silver candle holders and several photo albums Tim’s been guided through by Alfred over the past year. Bruce settles the photo book in the center of one of the doilies, right in between—

“Are those—how did you—are those the books I made for my parents?” Tim asks. His throat isn’t just _tight_. There’s a goddamn boa constrictor squeezing the living daylights out of his windpipe now. 

“Merry Christmas, Tim,” Jason says from over on one of the couches. “I’ve been hiding them for _months_. You don’t make it easy, you nosy little ninja sneak.”

“But—” Tim starts. 

Bruce pulls him into a hug. “Jason and I went out and checked out every Goodwill we could last year till we found the right one,” he says. “Did you really have to go halfway across Gotham to drop them off?”

Tim laughs wetly. 

“All of your photos are so good, Tim,” Bruce murmurs, one arm tight around Tim’s shoulderblades, one hand massaging the base of his skull. “I’m sorry your parents didn’t take the time to see that. I’d love to see more of your photos sometime, if that’s okay with you. Maybe we can go to one of the state parks in the spring, and find some good lanscapes for you to shoot?”

“Yeah, okay,” Tim laughs through his building tears. “That sounds really good. I’d—I’d be happy to show you. Sometime.”

“Whatever you’re comfortable with,” Bruce reassures. “When you’re ready.”

“And _I_ expect you to do my graduation photos this year,” Jason chimes in. “I’ll pay you in M&Ms and skateboard wheels.”

“Hey, quiet in the peanut gallery,” Bruce fake-scolds. “We’re having a _moment_ over here.”

“Yeah, Jason, they’re having a moment,” Dick says, grin clear in his voice, and there’s a distinctly-Jason-sounding squawk a second later.

Tim’s face is buried in Bruce’s hand-knit sweater, courtesy of Alfred as always, and his eyes are puffy, and his throat is making those shameful little choking noises that always happen when he needs to cry but can’t quite do it at the moment, and he’s a little bit embarrassed but a whole lot loved. And if this is what it’s like to have a family? All the crazy time together, the acceptance, the being there for each other just because, forgiving and laughing and supporting each other through the days? Tim can forget his parents for a minute. Forget the wishes he still has every day that they’ll come back, that they’ll praise his hard work, that they’ll want to go do something like hike through a park or go grocery shopping with him. He has love tonight. He has value, and hugs, and heckling, and a place he fits. A place where he’s not just tolerated—he’s _liked_. He’s needed, he’s _wanted_. 

It’s enough.
